One day in the early morning hours, Veer saw some ladies and kids gather around a heap of wood logs. As he saw them Veer asked&nbsp;his granny,</p>\n\n<p>Veer: Granny, where are these people going and what are they doing?</p>\n\n<p>Granny: Veer, they are preparing for Holika Dahan Pooja.</p>\n\n<p>Veer: What is Holika Dahan Granny; Can you please explain it to me?</p>\n\n<p>Granny: (smile) Ok Son! It has religious values and I will explain it with the famous&nbsp;story behind Holika Dahan.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story Begins-</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a demon king called Hiranyakashyap. He believed himself to be the real god. He wanted everyone in his kingdom to worship him. Rest all the other gods and goddess should be destroyed. In front of the king&rsquo;s power all the people obeyed him and all the temples and the idols of gods were demolished.</p>\n\n<p>However, there was someone in Hiranyakashapya home, who dare to differ from his thoughts. It was his own son Prahalad, who did not worship him. He used to pray and bow down to the all mighty Lord Vishnu.</p>\n\n<p>This act of his own son made Hiranyakashyap very angry. The level of anger reaches to this extent that he decided to kill him. As disobedience of Prahalad revokes the people of his kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>To get his son killed he called his demon sister Holika. Sister Holika has a vardaan(boon)&nbsp;that she cannot be burnt alive in the fire. Therefore she decided to use this magical power of her to kill Prahalad. One evening she loved Prahalad and artfully she brought him to her lap. Then she sat over the huge bonfire, thinking that Prahalad will die soon and she will come back safely.</p>\n\n<p>Veer: Then what happened Granny? What happened to Prahalad?</p>\n\n<p>Granny: (Smile) But, something unexpected happens, God took favour of Prahalad, as he was worshipping lord Vishnu, always with his pure heart. On the other hand, Holika died as she had the ill intension of killing a small child, just because he was worshipping the real power &ldquo;God&rdquo;!</p>\n\n<p>In the end, his father was shocked as Holika&rsquo;s powers did not work. And Prahalad came out safely while he was chanting &ldquo;Lord Vishnu&rdquo;, who saved him while wicked Holika has burned away.</p>\n\n<p>So what did you learned from this story Veer?</p>\n\n<p>Veer: ( Excited) That we should always worship god</p>\n\n<p>Granny: Of course and also&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>Good always beats evil</strong>&rdquo;. So you should always help others and never use your strength to harm others.</p>\n\n<p>Importance of the story : We do the bonfire in the evening a day before the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/tag/holi\">Holi festival</a>, to embark the presence of Goodness and humanity while remembering Prahalad and Lord Vishnu.</p>\n\n<p>Veer: (Politely) Granny can I&nbsp;also go and see the bonfire in the evening?</p>\n\n<p>Granny hugged Veer and nod her head in confirmation.</p>\n', '2021-02-04 15:56:27', '2021-07-27 07:07:48'),

To start your day on a positive note, Generate positive vibrations and help facing problems, puja is important', '<p>Every religion can be termed as a complex system of beliefs that binds both faith and values together. Not only is it unique in its way, but also acts as a source of confidence and peace for many of us. Puja is one of the most integral parts of this belief system and is a procedure that has been followed for ages.</p>\n\n<p>We perform pujas every day and special pujas on festivals and important occasions of our life. <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/benefits-of-online-pandit-ji\">Performing puja</a> on such days not only makes it memorable but is also auspicious at the same. While the elders understand the significance, the younger generation might find it hard to understand why we need to perform puja.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the roots of our faith, the bond between the devotee and the deity becomes stronger, and one gets to learn the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/pandit-ji-for-puja-near-me\">importance of puja</a>. However, we tried to answer the most common question asked &ndash; &ldquo;what is puja and what is it important.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Read on to learn and discover how puja can be beneficial for yourself and your family.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Puja?</h3>\n\n<p>Puja or also written as &quot;pooja&quot; is derived from Sanskrit, which means &quot;adoration&quot;, &quot;reverence&quot;, and &quot;worship.&quot; The word is also defined in various ways by the pundits and the acharyas. As per one interpretation, the word &quot;puja&quot; comprises the two letters &quot;pa&quot; and &quot;ja.&quot;&nbsp; The letter &quot;pa&quot; stands for repetition of the <a href=\"/what-is-puja-and-why-is-it-important\">Hindu sacred</a> texts ceremonially, and &quot;ja&rdquo; refers to the recitation.</p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, puja is a ritual that is followed every day in most Hindu households. Offerings are made to the deity, to receive blessings in return. During the puja, the devotee repeats or japs the sacred chants which connect him/her to God and helps attain peace.</p>\n\n<h3>Puja in the morning</h3>\n\n<p>Daily puja is mostly performed in the morning as these hours are known to be sacred, auspicious, and fruitful. As puja involves the recitation of <a href=\"/significance-of-bell-in-a-temple\">slokas or mantras</a>, performing the same during the calm and peaceful morning hours is considered apt. Pundits also believe that the Godly bodies are very receptive to the prayers performed during the mornings.</p>\n\n<h3>How to prepare yourself for daily puja?</h3>\n\n<p>Most of the homes have a special place for performing puja. If there is none, you can pick a place that is free from distractions and is peaceful.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Use a fresh piece of cloth or a mat. Sit facing East or North.</li>\n	<li>Clean the space as well as the idols by sprinkling just a few water drops. You need to use a separate cloth to clean the idols and apply kumkum.</li>\n	<li>You need to place two dreams (oil lamp) on both sides of the mandapam. One deepam should face the sun i.e. the east and the other should face north. Once done, light the lamps using cow ghee, or oil.</li>\n	<li>After you light the lamps, you can recite stotras or slokas as per your convenience or tradition.</li>\n	<li>While reciting the slokas, you can decorate the idols of the god with flowers, offer naivedyam and incense sticks.</li>\n	<li>You can then end the puja with aarti. While performing aarti, you need to ring the bell as it is believed that it &ldquo;wakens&rdquo; the gods.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Why is it important to perform puja?</h3>\n\n<p>Performing pooja every day not only renews your faith but can also help bring your family together for an auspicious start of the day. There are many benefits of doing puja every day and a few of them are listed below.</p>\n\n<h3>Helps start your day on a very positive note</h3>\n\n<p>Performing puja every day brings contentment and peace to your soul. As you start your day with slokas or mantras and puja, you are filling your mind with positivity. Such a routine helps you stay calm the whole day, enabling you to take care of various chores and challenges with confidence.</p>\n\n<h3>Brings your family together</h3>\n\n<p>When you perform puja with all the members of your family together, it becomes a ritual over time. This way, your family comes together every morning, where no one is distracted and is very happy and thankful for being united.</p>\n\n<h3>Generates positive vibrations</h3>\n\n<p>The chants and the mantras fill the house with very positive vibrations. As you ensure to clean the house and take bath before performing puja, the house is clean. When you light the camphor or incense sticks, their magical aroma fills the house with harmony. <a href=\"/importance-of-kanak-dhara-stotra\">The positive vibrations</a> created flow through the house for the rest of the day as well. You can increase the same by playing audios of slokas during the morning and evening every day.</p>\n\n<h3>Helps you face problems and handle challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Puja improves our focus and reaffirms our faith in god. It helps us stay balanced and calm, and gets rid of negative thoughts, fear, temper, etc, preparing us for challenges. It increases your faith to remain strong and brings inner peace.

It is special and is a source of peace and prosperity. Puja is an important part of Hinduism that&rsquo;s been present for a long time. Therefore, Puja is indicative of our beliefs and what they represent in our life.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pooja-booking\">Puja</a> refers to offering prayers or worship, notably of the sacred image. According to <a href=\"\">Ādi purāṇa</a>, there are six parts of worship - association with sacred, invitation, installation, worship, and immersion. Each ritual has its specific rules and can differ accordingly. Usually, devotees can do Puja alone. However, some rituals require priests since the rituals and hymns can vary. A Puja can be performed for a particular announced intention or simply as an act of devotion. The Puja done in temples are often more detailed especially during festivals like Mahashivratri, <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/durga-puja-with-paath\">Durga Puja</a>, etc. There are variations with different locations.</p>\n\n<h3>Importance of Puja</h3>\n\n<p>As you practice Puja, you purify your body, mind, and intellect and start a new beginning. So, if you find you need to repair your inner self and start anew, a Puja alone will help you get there. By praying for 15-20 minutes daily, a person starts connecting with his inner peace and gradually troubles come to an end. Prayer develops positive energy in the mind and the body becomes healthy.</p>\n\n<p>When doing a Puja your body, mind, and consciousness are all united and centered on one thing. We recite the deity&#39;s name with complete admiration and respect. It&rsquo;s a perfect way to discipline yourself and make your mind focused. If one is filled by stressful emotions, burdened with pressure or difficulties, or actually cannot understand which direction to transform, then a Puja will aid in calming the mind and finding a path that was previously blocked. Your negativity will have a serious effect on your house and your loved ones too. So not only does a Puja benefit you but also your surroundings.</p>\n\n<h3>Daily Puja Time</h3>\n\n<p>Veda recommends doing puja five times a day. The first one is the early morning at 4:30 AM in the Brahmi muhurtham, followed by puja at 9 AM and then a Mid-day puja at 12:00 PM. After which you have to let the deity relax. Later, perform Sandhya puja again in the evening between 4:30 PM and 6:00 PM. At last, we have Shayana puja at 9:00 PM to bring God to sleep. Since the current lifestyle does not encourage one to do the same, it is advisable to do pooja at least twice a day, one in the morning and then again in the evening.</p>\n\n<p>Brahma Muhurta is ideal for Sandhya Vandan, Meditation, Prayer, and Study. According to Vedas, the Brahma Muhutahm is dawn right before sunrise. Therefore, this time can differ from different locations and seasons. Similarly, Sandhya Puja is before sunset. Prayer, Meditation, Kirtan, Yajna, and Aarti are <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pooja-booking\">five parts of this Puja</a>. A devotee follows it by themselves or at the temple.</p>\n\n<h3>How to Perform Daily Puja</h3>\n\n<p>As per the Vedic scriptures, performing the regular pooja in the morning hours benefits the individual. The morning&#39;s quiet hours help maintain concentration and build a clear mind, increasing the person&#39;s aura. The next query in line is, how can one complete the morning puja?</p>\n\n<p>First, take a bath. Wear clean cotton clothes before you do your pooja. To gain concentration, with your preferred god in mind, sit facing east or north to meditate. Wash the puja room and light lamps(Diya). Start with the reciting hymns for <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/ganesh-puja\">Lord Ganesa</a>. Say shlokas that refer to your house deity. Make sure you clean the deity.</p>\n\n<p>You can recite the mantra while offering flowers. Light the dhoops sticks and spread the vapors throughout the house. Based on how much time you have, you can continue reading the shlokas. Give naivedyam(नैवेद्यम) to God - it may be fruit, honey, or something you feel like offering to God. Perform aarti when reciting similar verses.</p>\n\n<p>For Evening Puja, it should be done after the sunsets and before dark. Light lamps( Diya) in the evening. You can use either ghee or oil. One should never play conch or bells in the evening worship. In this time the Gods and Goddesses go to sleep. Flowers etc. need not be broken in the evening. For worshipping, either collect them first or it would be best not to include them in this time of worship. The place of worship should be veiled in the night so that there is no disturbance while God is sleeping. Once you shut the Puja place, open it at dawn.</p>\n\n<h3>Some of the common items used in Puja are:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Lamp oil</li>\n	<li>Cotton wicks for the lamps</li>\n	<li>Japa mala</li>\n	<li>Mat to sit on while performing puja</li>\n	<li>Puja utensils</li>\n	<li>Flowers and a flower bowl to hold them</li>\n	<li>Dhoop sticks and a stand to put them.</li>\n	<li>Aarti puja Diya or spoons to perform aarti</li>\n	<li>Camphor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Things not to do while performing Puja</h3>\n\n<p>Negative thoughts, debate, conversation, sleep, food, travel, any kind of noise etc.</p>\n\n<p>should be avoided. The Puja is made to lighten our mood and create a positive outlook towards our lives. The same goes for one&rsquo;s physical appearance. Sitting for Puja in dirty attire with unhygienic is not allowed. Make sure you take a bath before every Puja and clean the place of worship. You should be wary of the direction you sit or perform the Puja/ Aarti. Directions like South is not appropriate for worship. The puja and aarti should end before 12 noon. The puja or aarti is not performed between 12 PM and 4 PM. It is considered prohibited by the Vedas. Bathrooms and Toilets should be away from Puja&#39;s place. You can ask priests to know more about the prohibition during pujas. For example, an incensed stick is not used in havans. It is replaced with dhoop or Diya.</p>\n\n<p>Now you have all the information you need to know before doing a Puja. While everything takes time, so do prayers. Regardless of your busy lifestyle, always be regular and consistent with your prayer. Slowly but surely, you will see definite results.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '2021-03-19 09:53:13', '2021-07-27 07:07:48'),

Whenever you want to start your work it is important to worship lord Ganesha to succeed in work and to get the desired fruit of your work.', '<p>In the Indian culture, there has been a tradition of Mangalacharan or the worship of deities before beginning any work. This is to ensure the success of any work. To perform a task smoothly and smoothly, it is necessary to worship Shree Ganesh for the first time. That is why in Sanatan Dharma, the beginning of any work starts with the worship of Shree Ganesh. Any devotee who fasts or worships Lord Ganesha surely receives the blessings of the Lord and the desired fruit. Some people also write Shree Ganeshaya Namah at the time of the inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from this, it is also a custom that Sri Ganesh is worshipped before all the deities. Most people know about this custom, but very few people know why <a href=\"/product/ganesh-puja\">Ganesha is worshipped first.</a> While many people don&rsquo;t know this, it has an interesting story. Actually, in order to avoid any hindrance in worship, rituals, and work, Lord Ganesha is worshipped first. His blessing is obtained before beginning any important task.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Story</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Once a dispute arose among all the gods on who should be worshipped first before any ceremony on the earth. All the gods started to discuss the reasons why they should be prayed first and claimed themselves the best. Narad Muni, a divine Sage, after seeing this situation advised all the gods to go to Mt Kailash to Lord Shiva. He asks them to take the help of Lord Shiva and resolve the dispute. Thus, all the gods reached near Lord Shiva. He saw the quarrel between them and then decided to give them a task in order to test them. He organized a competition for all the deities. He asked them to sit in their respective <em>vahana</em> and take a round of the whole universe. In this competition, whoever revolves around the universe and reaches them first, will be considered as the god to be the first worshipped.</p>\n\n<p>All the gods set out for their journey with their vehicles. Lord Ganesh was also a part of this competition. However, Ganesha, unlike the other gods who orbited the universe, completed the seven rounds by orbiting his <a href=\"/product/mahamritunjay-jaap\">parents Shiva-Parvati</a> and stood with folded hands in front of him. When all the deities returned after doing their task, Lord Shiva declared Shri Ganesh victorious in the competition. All the gods were astonished to hear this decision and asked Shiva to explain the reason behind it. Then Shivji told him that the parents have been given the highest position in all the universe and all the worlds, which are considered to be higher than the gods and all the creation. Then all the gods agreed with this decision of Lord Shiva. Since then, Lord Ganesh was first considered to be revered.</p>\n\n<p>This is the reason that Lord Ganesha began to be worshipped among the gods for the first time due to the use of his sharp intellect. Since then, Ganesh Vandana is considered auspicious before every important event or festival.&nbsp; Most people remember Lord Ganesh before starting any auspicious work.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>How to Establish Lord Ganesh In your House</strong></h2>\n\n<p>You can go to the market and select the idol of Ganapati and then bring the statue home. While purchasing the idol of Ganesha, make sure that his vehicle, a mouse, is also there. The idol should be such that, in which, Ganesha is giving blessings with his hand i.e. one hand should be in <em>Varada</em> posture. Also, keep in mind that they have modak in other hands. If he does not have modak in his hand, then worshipping such an idol of Lord Ganesh is considered inauspicious.</p>\n\n<p>Before bringing him home, clean the place of worship thoroughly and sprinkle Ganga water throughout the house. Then by laying a red cloth on a clean area, place Akshat i.e. rice on it, and install Ganapati on top of them. After this, give Lord Ganesh a bath with Ganges water with the help of Durva grass and offer yellow clothes to the Lord. With this, you can also offer moli as a garment.&nbsp; After bathing, offer Akshat and flowers by applying Tilak to Lord Ganpati with roli and offer dear modak. After this, perform Aarti and Kirtan. <a href=\"/product/bodysoul-meditation-incense-sticks\">Do keep Panchameva daily in Prasad.</a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How to do Vandana</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Before worshipping, sit in a straight posture and collect all the materials: flowers, incense, lamp, camphor, roli, molly red, sandalwood, modak, etc. Wednesday is believed to be dedicated to Lord Ganesha. Some people also keep fast to get the blessings of Lord Ganesha. Tulsi Dal and Tulsi leaves should not be offered to Lord Ganesh. However, Durva grass can be offered to him after plucking from a clean place and washing it. Modak (laddus) is very much loved by Lord Ganesha, so offer him prasad made of pure ghee.</p>\n\n<p>Read the mantra of Shri Ganesha, &ldquo;<a href=\"/product/griha-pravesh\">Shri Gan Ganpataye Namah</a> &rdquo; 108 times, to yields good results.

While meditating on Shree Ganesh, one should be pure and happy with the spiritual mind. After worship, remember all the deities. Always welcome and worship them in the same manner and spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Ganesha takes a formidable form in the path of obstacles to remove all the obstacles of his devotees.

Prayag, Ujjain, Nashik and Haridwar are the four places where Kumbh Mela is organized.', '<p>The history of Kumbh Mela is at least 850 years old. It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya started it, but according to some legends, Kumbha started from the beginning of the sea churning. It has been told in the scriptures that the year of the earth is the day of the gods, so every twelve years, Kumbh is organized again at one place. The twelve years of the gods come after 144 years of the earth. It is believed that after 144 years, Kumbh is organized in heaven, so that year Mahakumbh is held on earth. Prayagraj has been designated as the real place for Mahakumbh.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>History of Kumbh Mela</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The Kalash is called Kumbh which means pitcher. This festival is related to the nectar(amrit) in urn which came out during the sea churning. Once Indra and the gods fell weak due to the curse of Maharishi Durvasa, the demon who attacked and defeated the gods. All the gods together approached Lord Vishnu and told him everything. Then <a href=\"/product/satyanarayan-katha\">Lord Vishnu</a> advised the gods to go against the demons and churn the Kshira Sagar and extract the nectar(<em>Amrit</em>). At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity engaged in an attempt to extract the nectar by making a treaty with the demons. At the behest of the deities, Indra&#39;s son &#39;Jayant&#39; flew into the sky carrying the Amrit Kalash. The demons chased Jayant to fetch the nectar and after a while, they caught Jayant in the midway and there was a fierce battle between Dev and Demon for 12 days to take possession of the Amrit Kalash.</p>\n\n<p>Some of its drops fell in the three rivers of the earth. Kumbh is organized at the place where these drops fell. The names of those three rivers are Ganga, Godavari and Kshipra. The nectar that came out in the churning fell at these places- Haridwar, Prayagraj, Ujjain and Nashik. Hence the Kumbh Mela has been held at these four places only after every three years. After 12 years, this fair returns to its first place. This is the reason that the <a href=\"/product/kumbh-vivah-sanskaar-puja\">Kumbh Mela</a> is celebrated at these four places. Kumbh is divided into 4 parts. For example, if the first Kumbh is in Haridwar, then after 3 years, the second Kumbh is in Prayagraj and then the third Kumbh is in Ujjain after 3 years, and then after 3 years, the fourth Kumbh is in Nashik.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>When Does Khubh Mela Occur?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Jupiter and the Sun planets play an important role in deciding the date and place of the Kumbh Mela. The location and date of the fair are determined only by entering the zodiac signs of Jupiter and the Sun.</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>In the year in which <em>Brihaspati</em> enters <em>Kumbh Rashi</em>(Aquarius) and the <em><a href=\"/product/navgraha-shanti-puja-with-jaap\">Surya Grah</a></em> enters <em>Mesh Rashi</em>, then in that year, Kumbh Mela is held in the city of Dev Haridwar. It falls in the Magh month of the Hindi calendar.</li>\n	<li>The year Kumbh Mela takes place in Prayagraj is the year when <em>Surya Grah</em> enters <em>Makar Rashi </em>(Capricorn) and<em> Brihaspati </em>enters<em> Mesh Rashi </em>or<em> Vrishab Rashi</em>. It takes<em> </em>place in Chaitra, the first month of the Hindu calendar.</li>\n	<li>In the year in which the <em>Surya Grah</em> and <em>Jupiter(Brihaspati Grah</em>) enter the same <em>Singh Rashi</em>, the Kumbh Mela is held in Nashik, Maharashtra in that year. Nashik<em> </em>Kumbha takes place in Bhadrapada month.</li>\n	<li>In the year when <em>Brihaspati</em> enters <em>Singh Rashi</em>) and Sun God enters <em>Mesh Rashi</em>, then this Kumbh Mela takes place in Ujjain. It is also called Simhastha Kumbh because it is related to the <em>Singh Rashi</em> sign. Simhastha Kumbh takes place in the month of Vaishakh.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><strong>Festival of Kumbh</strong></h2>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Kumbh in Haridwar: Ardh Kumbh is also organized in Haridwar and Prayag at a gap of six years between the two Kumbh festivals. Haridwar is located under the Shivalik mountain of the Himalayan mountain range. In ancient texts, Haridwar is also known by the names of Tapovan, Mayapuri, Gangadwar and Mokshdwar. The religious significance of Haridwar is huge. It is a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus.</li>\n	<li>Kumbh in Prayag: Prayag Kumbha has special significance because it is held after 12 years at the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and <a href=\"/product/saraswati-puja\">Saraswati</a>. Prayagraj&#39;s Kumbh Mela has the highest importance among all the fairs.</li>\n	<li>Kumbh in Nashik: Once in 12 years Simhastha Kumbh Mela is held in Nashik and Trimbakeshwar. Joti ling, one of the 12 in India, is located in the holy city called Trimbakeshwar. This place is located at a distance of 38 km from Nashik and the Godavari river originated from here as well.</li>\n	<li>Kumbh in Ujjain: This festival takes place in Ujjain on the day of Kartik Amavasya. Apart from Ujjain, the remaining are Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Kashi, Kanchipuram and Dwarka. It is said that <a href=\"/product/mahamritunjay-jaap\">Lord Shiva</a> killed the Tripura demon in Ujjain.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to religious belief, all the sins of people who worship devoutly in Kumbh are cut off and they get salvation. Kumbh bathing is considered to be special because it is believed that on this day the gates of heaven worlds are opened on this day and thus bathing on this day gives the soul easy access to the higher realms.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Rules to Follow in Kumbh Mela</strong></h2>\n\n<p>If you are going to have a Kumbh bath, keep in mind that the bath has a special rule.

Don\'t see the moon on the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi and include Prasad as peda or modak for Ganesh Chaturthi', '<p>Ganesh Chaturthi is considered to be one of the largest festivals in India. Ganesh Chaturthi is also known as Ganesh Utsav and Vinayaka Chaturthi. According to the Hindu calendar, Lord Ganesha was born on the fourth day of the duty date in the month of Bhadrapada. This year, the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated on 10 September 2021. Lord Shiva and Parvati&#39;s son Ganesha is said to be the god of wisdom, wisdom, prosperity and good fortune. While Ganesh Chaturthi festival is celebrated all over India, but widely in Maharashtra. During the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi, which is celebrated for 11 days, people keep Lord Ganesha in the house for 10 days and perform Ganesh Visarjan on the 11th day. On the Ganesh Utsav, people greet each other with the warm wishes of <a href=\"/product/ganesh-puja\">Ganesh Chaturthi</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Story Behind Ganesh Chaturthi</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Goddess Parvati was the creator of Ganapati. In the absence of Lord Shiva, he used his sandalwood paste to make Ganesha and put it to bathe. While he was gone, Lord Shiva fought with Ganesha and did not allow him to enter as per the orders of his mother. Enraged, Lord Shiva beheaded Ganesha. When Parvati saw this scene, she took the form of Goddess Kali and threatened to destroy the world. This alarmed everyone and he requested Lord Shiva to find a remedy and pacify the wrath of Goddess Kali. Shiva then immediately ordered all his followers to find a child, whose mother carelessly went back towards her child and brought her head. The first child seen by the followers was an elephant and they ordered, cut off his head and brought it to Lord Shiva. <a href=\"/product/mahamritunjay-jaap\">Lord Shiva</a> immediately placed the head on Ganesha&#39;s body and brought it back to life. Mother Kali&#39;s wrath subsided and Goddess Parvati was once again overwhelmed. All God blesses Ganesha and today is the day celebrated for the same reason.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Other Interesting Story of Ganesh Chaturthi</strong></h2>\n\n<p>There are many rituals and customs during this festival that people observe - a popular tradition after the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi is to avoid seeing <a href=\"/product/chandra-grah-shanti\">the moon</a>. Seeing the moon on Ganesh Chaturthi creates a mithya dosham or mithya stigma, which means a false accusation of stealing something. According to mythology, on the fourth day of the month of Bhadrapada (Chaturthi), Lord Ganesha was returning home with Mooshak, the moon god Chandra started laughing loudly and commenting on his stomach and small rat. To teach Moon a lesson, Lord Ganesha cursed him that no light would ever fall on him. Thus, the moon disappeared into the sky. Moon and other gods apologized and God bowed. However, once cursed it cannot be fully withdrawn. It can only be reduced. So Lord Ganesha reduced his curse and said that whichever day one sees the moon, on the fourth day of the Hindu month, Bhadrapada will be cursed with falsehood.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Ganesh Chaturthi Preparations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Preparation for Ganesh Chaturthi starts about a month before the festival. This festival lasts for about ten days (from Bhadrapada Shud Chaturthi to Anant Chaturdashi). On the first day, a clay idol of Lord Ganesha is installed in the houses. <a href=\"/product/bhoomi-pujan\">The houses</a> are decorated with flowers. The temple witnesses the visit of a large number of devotees. Worship is done and bhajans are performed. Often, families gather to celebrate the festival. Locals organize and arrange pandals and install large idols of Lord Ganesha to celebrate the festival with friends and family. On the last day of ceremonies, the idol of Lord Ganesha is taken to the streets. People demonstrate their enthusiasm and joy in the form of dancing and singing on the streets with the idol. The idol is finally immersed in a river or sea. On this day, a large number of devotees express their happiness and offer their prayers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>During this festival, people sing devotional songs, dance, fast, bed in their homes, and burst firecrackers. People start the day worshiping and donate new clothes to worship Ganesha. To perform any type of worship requires cleanliness and prerequisite of body and mind. The idol of a Ganesha is bathed in perfumed water (abhishekam) and then covered with a new saffron cloth. It is securely placed on a pedestal and adorned with sandalwood paste and a garland of fresh flowers.</li>\n	<li>Modak, rice or flour dumplings filled with grated jaggery, coconut and dry fruits, is a popular food of the festival and is the main &#39;prasad&#39; offered to Lord Ganesha. Considered to be the favorite dessert of God, other delicacies of this festival include Appam, Peda, Sundal, Barfi, Laddu, and Karanji.</li>\n	<li>Lord Ganesha is worshiped with sixteen rituals. <a href=\"/online-pooja-booking\">The prayers</a> are followed by &quot;Puranic Mantras&#39;&#39;, which are chanted during Ganesh Chaturthi Puja. Some of the popular Ganesh Puja mantras sung by devotees on this day are &#39;Ganesh Shubh Laabh mantra&rsquo;, &#39;Ganesh Gayatri Mantra&#39;, and &#39;Vakratunda Ganesh Mantra&#39; among others. After this, the devotees bow before Lord Ganesha and pray for the good of all. They also apologize for any mistake and ask God to cleanse their sins.</li>\n	<li>The Ganesh Chaturthi ritual concludes with the aarti of Lord Ganesha. Aarti is performed twice that day, once in the morning and again in the evening. On the 11th day of the festival, Ganesh Visarjan is celebrated, in which the idol is immersed in water.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Ganesh Chaturthi Pooja Vidhi</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ganesh worship begins by installing a clay statue of Lord Ganesha in your home. Various dishes are cooked for food-to-be-offered (bhoga). The idol is bathed in pure water and then decorated with flowers. Jyoti is lit and then the aarti begins. At this time various hymns, and mantras are chanted. It is believed that by chanting mantras with full devotion, the idol has vital life. It is also believed that during this period, Ganesha visits the home of his devotees and brings prosperity and good luck with them. For this reason, this day is celebrated as a very auspicious day.</p>\n\n<p>Although a large number of sweets are offered to Lord Ganesha during worship, Modak is known as the favorite dessert of God and hence it is one of the main dishes made on this day. Other dishes include Karanji, Laddu, Barfi and Ped. <a href=\"/who-is-the-first-worshipped-among-god\">Worshiping</a> Ganpati Yantra will give you a lot of success in life.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '2021-04-10 08:18:10', '2021-08-31 10:47:24'),

From the Vedic period till today, it has been a tradition to observe auspicious times before performing any work. The work done in the auspicious time is done smoothly, it is the word of sages and scholars which is also empirical.</p>\n\n<p>What is the importance of Muhurta, and how the auspicious Muhurta is selected, and what information about the goodness of the day, date, constellation, Karan, etc. is an important contributor? Let&rsquo;s know what determines the nature of the auspicious and inauspiciousness of all these constituent elements of the Muhurta and what direction and condition the work gets from it. According to the folk tradition, choosing the auspicious time to start any auspicious task is called Muhurta selection. To ensure the accomplishment of work, Muhrat is optimal to start your work in an auspicious time that remains in the hearts of all. The practice of watching Muhurta has been going on for thousands of years.</p>\n\n<p>It is but natural that the work done in this inauspicious time will either not be completed or will be delayed or with disruption or it may or may not happen. But those tasks have negative energy surrounding them that cannot guarantee that the work done in that time will be completed or there is no interference in it. But it is true that instead of choosing an inauspicious time, it will be good to choose the auspicious time, because if a good time does not change our fate, then it can make the path of success easier.</p>\n\n<p>The Hindu calendar also has only 12 months in a year. The month is also 30 days only. The full moon ends on the full moon day. Purnimanta month is prevalent in North India. At the same time, Amavasya ends Amant month. Amant has more recognition in the south. The first date of the month is Pratipada. Then there are fourteen dates till Dwitiya, Tritiya, etc. Chaturdashi. This is followed by the full moon on the fifteenth date.

With consultation from an astrologer, you will get remedies to solve the upcoming problems in your life. ', '<p>Looking at the sky, the question arises in the mind: what are the planets and constellations?</p>\n\n<p>Why do we give it so much significance before doing any new or important work? Why do</p>\n\n<p>Kundali and its consultation hold an important part in our lives?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What is Astrology?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>It was due to these questions that man began to see, examine and understand the planets and stars of the sky. Soon, people around started understanding the celestial movements. People began to relate the events around them to the activities of planets and constellations and thus became a scripture, which we now <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/category/astrologer-consultation\">call astrology</a>. According to Vedic knowledge, astrology can be defined as:</p>\n\n<p>&#39;<em>Jyotishan Suryadi Grahananam Bodhakam Shastra</em>&#39;</p>\n\n<p>This means that the science that gives knowledge of the planets (planets, constellations, comets, etc.) and time are called astrology i.e. the science which provides astrology. While today astrology is common, it is perceived to have started in India. In a way, it helps us navigate our daily life emotionally, physically, and financially. In this sense, it sits closer to spirituality and philosophy than astronomy.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why are Vedic Zodiac Signs important?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Just as the land is divided into several parts and the education of geography is given easily, similarly, astronomy has also been divided into 360 parts. They are categorized into 12 different zodiac signs and have 27 constellations too. Each zodiac located in the zodiac cycle is 30 degrees. The zodiac is actually the name of a special shape and appearance of the constellation of the planets in the sky. There is neither a scorpion nor a lion in the sky, the Maharishi has named the zodiac signs on the basis of familiar objects, keeping in mind the symmetry of the star clusters to facilitate identification. To understand precisely, four parts of each nakshatra are called Charan. The Moon transits in every zodiac and for two days. After that, it reaches a different amount. This pattern is given priority by Indian astrology.</p>\n\n<p>Each zodiac has its own shape and each zodiac has been named on the basis of this shape. All the zodiac signs have their own different significance. Your Vedic zodiac sign says a lot about you. Through these, your nature, personality, and habits can be easily known. Due to the influence of the constellations, zodiacs,&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/navgraha-shanti-puja-with-jaap\">nine planets</a>- qualities and defects can be predicted of the person. Due to different elements in <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/tag/astrologer-consultation-online\">Vedic astrology</a>, 12 zodiac signs are divided into four parts. These include water signs, fire signs, air signs,s and earth signs. According to astrology, there are 12 zodiac signs, these zodiac signs are named as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Aries</li>\n	<li>Taurus</li>\n	<li>Gemini</li>\n	<li>Cancer</li>\n	<li>Leo</li>\n	<li>Virgo</li>\n	<li>Libra</li>\n	<li>Scorpio</li>\n	<li>Sagittarius</li>\n	<li>Capricorn</li>\n	<li>Aquarius</li>\n	<li>Pisces</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In Vedic astrology, the horoscope is calculated based on the lunar sign. At the time of our birth, when the Moon(<a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/chandra-grah-shanti\">Chandra Grah</a>) rises in the sky, the zodiac sign is called our lunar sign. The sun-based zodiac is considered important in Western astrology. In this astrology, the signs that are with the sun(Surya Grah) at the time of birth are your sun sign. In Vedic astrology, the horoscope of a person is prepared by the position and calculation of the 12 zodiacs, 12 bhavas, and 27 nakshatras present in the horoscope. With the help of this horoscope, the important points, accomplishments, incidents of people&#39;s lives are known.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why is Astrology Important?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>People have been continuously trying to calm their curiosity. It has been continuously trying to solve the problems of creation, this effort has been called science today. In the same way, what can humans do next in their life? Why is it happening in life? He is curious to know the answers to these questions. Answers to these questions can be found through astrology. The planetary system in the human body is directly related to the outer solar system.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the effects resulting from their study can be interpreted.</p>\n\n<p>The importance of astrology can be clearly seen in our daily lives. We get the knowledge of festivals, festivals, etc. only by astrological calculations. The wide impact of astrology can be seen in the rural life of India. That is why even a farmer knows in which nakshatra the rain is good. When they should sow seeds. With the use of astrology, life can be reduced, the obstacles of life can be removed. More success can be achieved with less effort.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Western astrology, Vedic astrology observes the birth chart of a person. It follows the constellation zodiac, in which the horoscope is placed as a reference for a fixed point. While the Earth completes the four revolutions of the Sun in a year and the axis of the Earth also turns around every day and it takes many years to complete a cycle. Hence it is becoming very prevalent in the last few years.</p>\n\n<p>Astrology is not a way to change the future, nor does it claim to describe future events in the same way. It only tells about the positive and negative trends in an independent horoscope based on the position of the planets and after knowing this one can work on the negative areas to reduce these negative effects.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why take Online Consultation of an Astrologer?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>As we discussed, Kundali of every person is unique and caters to only that person. Unlike Western Zodiac signs, the navgrah (nine planets) influence a person&rsquo;s sign and thus decide their future. Thus, using a generalized platform for asking your questions might not work. An astrologer has expertise in calculating and foretelling the future on the basis of Kundali. Also, in the absence of correct knowledge of Astrology, the common people start trying</p>\n\n<p>Astrological remedies at the advice of anyone. But such tried measures can prove to be harmful at times. They can create more disturbance and bring unwanted trouble or increase your problems. Therefore, consulting with an astrologer helps in receiving correct advice and following good remedies to calm your doshas.</p>\n', '2021-05-06 07:13:49', '2021-07-27 07:07:48'),

With online pandit booking, you will get pandit Ji along with all puja material within a few minutes.', '<p>In today&#39;s run-of-the-mill life, where a person is barely able to find time for his family, he is unable to find time to remember and <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/who-is-the-first-worshipped-among-god\">worship his God</a>, to do puja. And if a person thinks of organizing a puja havan at home, when needed, it seems like a huge task. A lot of work comes in front of you in organizing this kind of event. Like first <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-ji\">finding Pandit Ji,</a> making a list of Puja material, collecting whole Puja material by visiting different places in the market, then reaching home to arrange pure wood for havan including havan kund, bringing flower garland, leaves, etc. All these mobilizations start to look crooked.</p>\n\n<p>Recall a story of Srimad Bhagavad Gita- it is the story of the child Dhruva. In a nutshell, the story tells that people worship deities for fulfilling the requests and desires. The common man&#39;s mind is like a child Dhurva. Everything that happens is according to the wish of God. A man approaches God so that he can gain salvation by devotion to God.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Who is Pandit?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Today, when the whole world has turned into a global village, why shouldn&rsquo;t the convenience of our Vedic traditions, rituals, rituals of religious worship etc. be made easy through modern resources? It cannot be denied that since ancient times, kings have arranged havans in India for the welfare of the general public. Earlier, there was a mutual guru-disciple tradition or the priest as an advisor in the King&rsquo;s court. Pandit means Dash or skilled in a piece of particular knowledge. Other terms like scholar or master can also be used to describe him. A pundit is a person who has knowledge of a particular discipline. In ancient India, the great scholar of Vedas and scriptures etc. was called <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-ji\">Pandit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Presently this relationship started to weaken with the change of time, due to which there are many reasons like - migration, urbanization, effects of globalization, etc. But still, people who believe in Hinduism are fulfilling their religious needs in some way, but are not satisfied with all of them. The main reasons for this are lack of knowledge of Vedic culture, availability of qualified pundits, pure worship materials, etc. Due to which all these religious events are not fully successful and devotees do not get the full benefit of them.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why do you need Pandit?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Our Hindu scriptures prescribe certain objects for worship. However, people who have started doing Puja or do havan rarely, might not know the correct information. Simultaneously, many Puja samagri can create confusion. For example, Betel nut is so important in Hindu religious rituals that worship does not begin without it. It is worth noting that there are two types of betel nuts and both are separate items. The betel nut which is eaten is large and round. On the other hand, the betel nut of Pooja is small in shape and has a peak at the top. Along with this, the floor of the betel nut is very flat, which makes the installation work easy. In the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/category/hindu-puja\">Indian Puja</a> Vidhan, the invocation of the gods or the start of the yagna, every work is started with the installation by placing betel nuts and betas on the sides of the pan. Now, the person who can differentiate between the correct type of betel nut will be Pandit.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a Puja place at home also has very restrictive rules that the person should follow. While God can be pleased by doing Puja and at the same time it also gives peace of mind. However, special things should be kept in mind while worshipping, otherwise, it can be inauspicious rather than auspicious. For instance, It is written in the scriptures that defective idols should not be worshipped. It is said that worshipping such deities does not yield any fruit. If there are such idols in your house, then you should remove them from your house and place them under a tree or give it to the temple. Apart from this, you should not keep the murtis where the gods are fighting. This always leads to creating tension and fighting at home. If <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/deepawali-laxmi-puja\">Goddess Lakshmi</a> is in standing mudra, then according to Vastu, you should not keep this picture. With this, Lakshmi does not stay in the house.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, many rituals and havan also require the supervision of an expert, i.e. Pandit. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/chaitra-navratri\">Navratri Vrat</a>, Haldi, asafetida, mustard oil, methi, garam masala, and coriander powder are not used. You should only eat rock salt instead of salt. Do not cook meals in refined oil or soybean oil. Do not rub the idol with your thumb in the idol bath. Do not start worshipping Lakshmi in the afternoon, at night, on Krishna Paksha, on Dwadashi date, and on Ashtami. Likewise, many other restrictions are there which we need to follow. Therefore, the role of Pandit is important and irreplaceable.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>How do Pandits help you?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>When you worship at your home, there is no priest while there is a priest in the temple. All the laws and rules of worship are followed in the temple, while the person in the house worships to reveal his devotion and for his own complacency. According to Vedic books, building a temple at home can also be harmful to you. However, you can allot a place of worship in the house for only one goddess or deity whom you consider highly. Some pujas at home do not <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/pandit-ji-for-puja-near-me\">require a Pandit</a>, like evening aarti, daily puja in the morning, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Festivals, celebrations, and fasting all have different meanings. All the celebrations and fasts of Hinduism are related to solar month, lunar month, and constellation month. Each festival has its specific day and time to perform the Puja. While some festival pujas can also be done by oneself with the supervision or advice of Pandit. For example, you can <a href=\"https://g.page/pujarambh?we\">consult an online Pandit </a>and ask him the rules and regulations to do Aarti or havan at home. It can be for Navrati Puja, Diwali Puja, Bhai-Duj, or more. With online booking, you can also organize Puja at your house or a temple. Here, you organize Office-opening puja, new house warming puja, Sarawati Puja, Dosh Nirvana Puja, and more.</p>\n', '2021-05-08 12:33:32', '2021-07-27 07:07:48'),

This is why people do Griha Pravesh Puja. <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/book-panditji-online-for-griha-pravesh\">Griha Pravesh Puja</a> is done for the purification and happiness of the house.</p>\n\n<p>We enter a house with new hopes and dreams. To achieve good luck and keep it devoid of any negativity, Griha Pravesh Puja is important. There is a belief among Hindus that worshipping and performing Havan before entering the house brings happiness and the abode of God. Many a time it happens that Vastu is not given much attention to while building a house, so all these problems get resolved during worship.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>According to the scriptures, there are three types of Griha Pravesh Puja.</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Apoorva Griha Pravesh Puja</strong>&ndash; When an entry is made in the new house that is built for the first time, it is called Apoorva Graha Pravesh.</li>\n	<li><strong>Sapoorva Griha Pravesh Puja</strong> &ndash; Sometimes a person stays in the house with their family and leaves his house empty for some time.

So, when someone first moves into a new house,</p>\n\n<p>then Puja is done. It is very important not only for the owner of the house but for all the people in the family. According to Vastu, the house is made up of five elements - Sun, Earth, Water, Fire, and Air and the right combination of all these brings happiness, health and happiness, and prosperity in the house. If the house is entered at an auspicious time, it makes life easier and the family has to face fewer troubles after moving to a new house.

(16, 'Why do we do Bhumi Pooja?', 'book-pandit-for-bhumi-pooja', 'bhumi-pujan.jpg', 'bhumi-pujan-pandit.jpg', '[4]', '[6]', 'According to Vedas, the land is considered to be the guardian of the whole world, which is why the earth has been given the status of the mother in Hindu scriptures.', '<p>According to Vedas, the land is considered to be the guardian of the whole world, which is why the earth has been given the status of the mother in Hindu scriptures. We all know that what we get from the earth; we built a house to live in, get food to eat, rivers, springs, streets, roads all pass through the ribs of the earth. Therefore, as per the scriptures, there is a purpose to worship the land before any type of construction on it, whether it is to build a house or public buildings or roads. It is believed that many types of obstacles arise in the construction work due to not worshipping the land. So, let&#39;s discuss how to worship the land (Bhumi Pooja), what is the method (vidhi) of doing a <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/book-panditji-online-for-bhumi-pujan\">Bhumi Pujan</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why do we do Bhumi Pooja?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Whenever any kind of construction work is to be started on any new land, before that the worship of the land is done. It is believed that if there may be some kind of defect on the land or any mistake could be made by the previous owner of that property, knowingly or unknowingly. If this has happened, Bhumi Pooja helps you by forgiving mistakes of every kind. Many times when a person buys land, it may be that the land has become impure due to the wrong actions of the former owner, so it is re-sanctified by Bhoomi Pujan. It is believed that the construction work gets completed smoothly by performing Bhoomi Puja. There is no loss of the person during or after construction and at the same time, one gets liberation from their upcoming problems.</p>\n\n<p>In Hindu scriptures, land has the status of the mother and is considered to be the sustainer of the world. According to the religious scriptures, Bhoomi Pujan should be done before starting the construction work on the land. It is believed that not performing Bhoomi Puja can lead to many obstacles in the construction work. As per religious beliefs, the faults related to land can cause many problems in the construction work. Bhoomi pooja is performed so that there are no problems in the construction work and the property is purified.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>How to do Bhumi Pooja</strong></h3>\n\n<p>First of all, after getting up early in the morning on the day of Pooja, the land that needs to be worshipped should be cleaned and purified. For Bhumi Pooja, the help of a <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-booking\">qualified Pandit</a> should be taken. At the time of worship, the pandit should sit facing the north and the person, who is the owner of the estate, should sit facing east. If the person is married, then make your spouse sit next to your left. <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/ganesh-puja\">Firstly, Lord Ganesha should be worshipped</a>. Silver serpent and Kalash are worshipped in Bhoomi Pujan. As per Hindu scripture, it is believed that Sheshnag has lifted the earth on his hood. The purpose of worshipping the silver snake is to get the blessings of Sheshnag.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, it is believed that just as Lord Sheshnag is taking care of the earth, so in the same way, he will also take care of the building that will be built on the same land. The belief behind keeping the Kalash is that since Sheshnag lives in the Ksheer Sagar, so by pouring milk, curd, ghee in the Kalash, he is requested to give his direct blessings. By putting coin and betel nut in the Kalash, it is believed that the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Ganesha will be obtained. Considering the Kalash as the symbol of the universe and the representation of Lord Vishnu, it should be prayed along with Goddess Lakshmi. Kalash sits on this land and always supports the building that will be built on the land.</p>\n\n<p>It is very important to get the Bhumi pooja done methodically, otherwise the possibility of delay in construction due to political, social, and divine obstacles increases.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Worship Material for Bhoomi Pujan</strong></h3>\n\n<p>While it is best to <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-ji\">consult a Pandit</a>, here are some <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/shop\">basic items that need before puja</a>. For land worship, gangajal, leaves of mango and betel tree, flowers, roli and rice, kalava, red cotton cloth, camphor, desi ghee, and kalash. Many types of fruits will also be necessitated. Other than that, you will also need, durba grass, Nag-Nagin Joda, Clove-cardamom, areca nut are required. Materials like incense sticks, coins, turmeric powder, etc. are also required.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Avoid these days to build a home in 2021</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Certain dates in the year 2021 are not suitable to start something grand as house construction. For example, starting the construction of a house between June 14 and July 13, could result in the loss of a family member. Similarly, starting construction between September 14 and October 13 is not good as per Vastu and may invite diseases and discomfort. Another date that you should look out for is March 14 to April 13, which can cause concern due to any unforeseeable reason. From 14 March till 13 April, we enter Kharmas. All auspicious works like marriage, engagement, housework, and house entry are not done in Kharmas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are some more examples that you should know before selecting a Bhoomi pooja date:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Chaitra</strong>- This is from March to April. This time should be avoided as it is said to bring difficulties for the owner of the house.</li>\n	<li><strong>Jeth</strong>- It is the month of June and the planets are not in a favorable position.</li>\n	<li><strong>Ashadh</strong>- Avoid the month of July for laying the foundation, as it brings loss, especially if the owner has cattle stock or business related to it.</li>\n	<li><strong>Shravan</strong>- It is the month of August and this time is not favorable as it can bring financial loss.</li>\n	<li><strong>Bhadrapada</strong>- Avoid September for puja for the foundation of your new house, as it can lead to quarrels and tension in the house.</li>\n	<li><strong>Ashwin</strong>- To avoid family disputes in the house, bypass October to lay the foundation of your new home, as per Vastu.</li>\n	<li><strong>Kartik</strong>- If the foundation is laid in the month of November, you will not be able to live inside the house peacefully.</li>\n	<li><strong>Magh</strong>- If the foundation is laid in this month, then it can create some kind of danger or fear</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While we have discussed some months to avoid, it is best that you should consult an expert to decide a date.</p>\n', '2021-07-27 07:07:48', '2021-08-09 09:55:55'),

Celebrated in India and across the world every year, Raksha Bandhan is a promise made by the siblings to protect and cherish the unbreakable bond they share. The conditional love provided by the siblings is celebrated during this day.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What does Raksha Bandhan mean?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The name Raksha Bandhan is made of the words &ldquo;Raksha&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bandhan&rdquo; and these mean protection and bond. During this festival, the sister ties a thread on the wrist of her brother which is the knot of protection. <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product-category/festival-puja\">The festival</a> is celebrated by all those who have a sibling bond, and even by those who do not share a blood relationship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>When is Raksha Bandhan Celebrated?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Rakhi or Raksha Bandhan is celebrated on the day of the full moon during the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/shravan-maas-ka-adhyatmik-mahatva\">Sharavana month</a> of the Hindu calendar. The festival which is celebrated every year will be celebrated on Sunday, 22nd August in 2021. Also, there is an auspicious time during which the ritual is to be carried out, and this year it is between 6:15 AM to 5:31 PM on 22nd August 2021.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Importance of Raksha Bandhan</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Raksha Bandhan is celebrated mostly in the western and the northern parts of India by Hindus and is also celebrated in various other states and countries. In the Jain community, Raksha Bandhan is celebrated where the devotees are given the ceremonial threads as a blessing. The festival is also celebrated by the Sikh community, where the sibling bond is celebrated in the name of Rakhari or &ldquo;Rakhardi.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>How and when did Raksha Bandhan originate?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The festival is said to have been celebrated centuries ago, and we can find various stories in Indian mythology related to the same. A few such stories from Hindu mythology are mentioned below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sachi and Indra Dev</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per the Bhavishya Purana, there was once a very fierce battle between the demons and the gods. During this, the deity of the rains and sky, Lord Indra was on the god&rsquo;s side and was facing a lot of resistance from King Bali. The war between the gods and demons went on for a long time, and the end did not seem near. By seeing this, Sachi, the wife of Lord Indra went to God Vishnu and received a sacred thread from him. She tied the thread around the wrist of her husband who then defeated King Bali and the demons and was able to recover Amaravati. Such a scared thread was also tied by the wife on the husband&rsquo;s wrist when they left for the war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Goddess Lakshmi and King Bali</strong></p>\n\n<p>This story too is related to Bhagavata Purana. As per the Vishnu Purana, Lord Vishnu won the war against King Bali and won the three worlds. As per mythology, the demon king asked Lord Vishnu to stay in this palace. The lord did accept the request but Goddess Lakshmi, wife of Lord Vishnu wanted him to return to Vaikuntha. She then tied a sacred thread on the wrist of King Bali and made him her brother. When he asked what she wanted as a return gift, she asked the demon king to let Lord Vishnu return back to Vaikuntha. Bali kept his promise and Lord Vishnu returned back to Vaikhunta along with Goddess Lakshmi.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Santoshi Maa</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another story of Hindu mythology says that Lord Ganesha&rsquo;s sons, Subh and Labh were sad that they did not have a sister. They then asked Lord Ganesha for a sister, and he agreed after Saint Narada intervened. This is how Lord Ganesha created the goddess Santoshi Maa through divine flames. The two sons of Lord Ganesha thus got a sister on the day of Raksha Bandhan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Draupadi and Lord Krishna</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can read in the Mahabharata that Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas tied Rakhi to God Krishna and Kunti too tied a Rakhi to Abhimanyu who happens to her grandson before they left for the war.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yamuna and Yama</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per another legend, the Lord of the death Yama did not visit his sister for 12 years. Yamuna then become sad. Lord Yama upon the suggestion of Ganga went to meet his sister, who was very happy, and performed a ritual to welcome her brother. Yama was happy and asked his sister what she wanted as a gift. She then expressed that she wishes to see her brother often. Lord Yama promised his sister that he would see her again and this made Yamuna immortal. This story is also the basis of the &ldquo;Bhai Dooj,&rdquo; festival, which too is based on the relationship of a brother and sister.</p>\n\n<p>Raksha Bandhan is a day that signifies the duty of both brother and sister. Both men and women celebrate the brother-sister relationship even when they are not related biologically. The sister ties the Raksha Bandhan around her brother&rsquo;s wrist and prays for his well-being and prosperity. The brother shows her gifts and promises to protect her always.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '2021-08-09 09:55:55', '2021-08-09 09:55:55'),

As after creating the world, Brahma set out for a tour to see his creation with his eyes. During this journey, he found the world quite calm and sad, after which he thought of changing it. With this thought, Brahma threw a few drops of water into the air from his kamandal, and Saraswati was born. Maa Saraswati was seen holding a Veena in her hands. Brahma asked her to play something, where he was mesmerized after hearing her voice and veena.</p>\n\n<p>After this Brahma requested Maa Saraswati to fill the world with music. Following his orders, the goddess did the same. It is said that when she played the veena, all the creatures of the world could speak. Since then she was named &#39;Saraswati&#39;.

During these nine days, devotees worship nine forms of Goddess Durga.', '<p><span dir=\"LTR\">The festival of Navratri has special significance among Hindus, with nine days entirely dedicated to Maa Durga (Goddess Durga) and her nine incarnations. There are four </span><span dir=\"LTR\">Navratris </span><span dir=\"LTR\">in a year, out of which two are Gupt </span><span dir=\"LTR\">Navratris</span><span dir=\"LTR\">.

Ashwin Navratri is also known as Maha Navratri. One reason for this is that this Navratri falls just before Dussehra as it ends on the day of Dussehra. The one that falls after Pitru Paksha is known as Sharad Navratri. Sharad Navratri begins the day after the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/pitra-dosh-puja\">Pitru Paksha</a> ends. During these nine days, devotees worship nine forms of Goddess Durga. It is believed that this festival marks the victory of Maa Durga over a demon named Mahishasura. Hence, she is called Mahishasuramardini, which means the destroyer of Mahishasura. It is believed that the demon had the combined powers of Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the protector), and Shiva (the destroyer), a story of which will be discussed down below. The worship of different forms of the Goddess Durga during the nine days of Navratri is also seen as the worship of Shakti.</span></p>\n\n<h2><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Story of Shardiya Navratri</span></strong></h2>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">There are two stories of celebrating the Navratri festival in the scriptures. According to the first legend, there was a demon named Mahishasura who was a great devotee of Brahma. He pleased Brahma with his penance and obtained a boon. According to the boon, no god, demon, or any human living on earth could kill him. After receiving the boon, he became very merciless and started creating panic in the three worlds. Disturbed by his terror, the deities together with Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh gave birth to Durga in the form of Mother Shakti. There was a fierce battle between <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/durga-saptashati-puja-and-paath\">Maa Durga</a> and Mahishasura for nine days and on the tenth day, Maa Durga killed Mahishasura. So, the tenth day of Navratri is celebrated as the victory of good over evil.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">According to another legend, Lord Shri Ram worshiped the Durga for nine days before invading Lanka and going for a war with Ravana. Pleased with his devotion, the mother blessed Shri Ram to attain victory in Lanka. On the tenth day, Lord Rama defeated Lanka king Ravana in battle and killed him, and conquered Lanka. This day is celebrated as Vijayadashami.</span></p>\n\n<h3><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Dates of each day of Shardiya Navratri 2021</span></strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">1st day - October 7 - Shailputri is worshipped</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">2nd day - October 8 - Brahmacharini is worshipped</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">3rd day - October 9- Worship of Chandraghanta and Kushmanda</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">4th day - October 10- Worship of Skandmata</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">5th day - October 11 - Worship of Katyayani Devi</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">6th day - October 12 - Worship of Kalratri Devi</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">7th day - October 13- Day of Mahagauri Puja</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">8th day - October 14 - Worship of Siddhidatri</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">9th Day - October 15- Dashami Navratri Parana/Durga Visarjan</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">The Shardiya Navratri shows the stages of Goddess Parvati&rsquo;s life. The nine goddesses that we worship in Navratri are:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Shailputri:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;Being the daughter of the mountain king Himalaya, Goddess Parvati is also called Shailputri. Certainly, the first knowledge mother Parvati got is from her father. She is celebrated and worshiped on the first day of Navratri.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Brahmacharini:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;Brahmacharini means when she found Shiva through penance. She is revered and worshiped on the second day of Navratri. She symbolizes that one day every woman has to leave her father&rsquo;s house and go to her husband&#39;s house.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Chandraghanta:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;Here, Goddess Parvati has a moon-shaped tilak on her head. It symbolizes that now she is the mother of all creatures. By worshiping her, the seeker automatically gets the siddhis arising from the Manipura Chakra and gets freedom from worldly troubles. She supports her husband Shiva, who has a similar moon on his head. It signifies how every wife has to assist her husband in the same way.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Kushmanda:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;She is called by the name of Kushmanda Devi due to the creation of the universe from her abdomen. She is worshiped and adored on the fourth day of Navratri. Worshiping Kushmanda destroys all the diseases and sorrows of the devotees.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Skandmata:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;Kartikeya, the son of Mother Parvati, is also named Skanda, that is why she is called the mother of Skanda. She is worshiped on the fifth day of Navratri. By invoking her, the accomplishments that arise from the awakening of the Vishuddha Chakra can be automatically achieved.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Katyayani:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;When Maa Parvarti was pleased with the penance of Maharishi Katyayani and after he was consumed in the fire of Yagya, she was born as a daughter to her, hence she is called Katyayani. She is celebrated and worshiped on the sixth day.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Kalratri:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;Goddess Parvati is the destroyer of all kinds of troubles, that is why it is called Kalratri. According to Devi Bhagavata Purana, Maa Kalratri removes planetary obstacles with Abhaya boon. Along with this, one gets freedom from unexpected crises.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Mahagauri:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;When she turned black due to severe penance, Shiva was pleased and washed her body with the holy water of Gangaji, then she became very radiant like an electric light. Since then she was named Mahagauri. Every woman who performs her fast, fasting, and acts of religion is called Mahagauri. Even impossible tasks become possible by worshiping this form of Durga.</span></li>\n	<li><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Siddhidatri:</span></strong><span dir=\"LTR\">&nbsp;This is the 9th form of Mother. She gives all kinds of blessings to the devotee who is completely dedicated to her, that is why she is called Siddhidatri. Likewise, the family members who keep taking the blessings of their mothers and do not make them sad in any way, then they get accomplishment and success in every sphere of life.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">How to do Navra</span></strong><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">tr</span></strong><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">i Puja?</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Before starting the Navratri Puja, it is necessary to establish the Kalash. It is said that without the establishment of the Kalash, the full fruit of worship is not attained. The establishment of Kalash has special significance in the worship of Navratri. It is believed that the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/navratri-sthapna-puja\">Kalash sthapana </a>is considered to be the form of Vishnu. Therefore Ghatasthapana or Kalash establishment is done before Navratri. It is also necessary to take care of the auspicious time to establish the Kalash. Before setting up the Kalash, clean the temple, and after that lay a red cloth. A copper or clay urn is then established, which is kept at the same place for 9</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">consecutive days. Fill the Kalash with Ganga water or clean water. Now put betel nut, perfume, durva grass, akshat, and coin in this water.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">After this, place 5 Ashoka leaves on the sides of the Kalash and cover the Kalash with a lid. Wrap a red cloth or red sardine on a coconut. Wrap some money in it with a chunni or cloth. Now tie the coconut and cloth with Raksha Sutra or Moli. After preparing it, place a barley pot (in which you are sowing barley) on the post or the ground. Now place some soil on it containing barley and then coconut on the lid of the pot. Your Kalash has been set up. Few things to keep in mind:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Take a bath early in the morning and wear clean clothes.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Keep the Kalash in the worship room of your house and tie a sacred thread around the earthen pot.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Chant the mantras and request Mother Durga to accept and reside the Kalash for nine days.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Offer flowers, fruits, incense, and lamps to the Kalash.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Recite Devi Mahatmyam and chant holy mantras.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Importance of Kalash and Barley Seeds</span></strong></h3>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">According to religious texts, the Kalash is considered a symbol of happiness, prosperity, and good luck. It is said that Lord Vishnu resides in the mouth of the Kalash. Rudra in the throat of the Kalash and Brahma in the root. At the same time, divine powers reside in the middle of the Kalash, so it is necessary and auspicious to establish the Kalash on the auspicious days of Navratri. During the establishment of the Kalash, barley is sown around the Kalash.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">According to the scriptures, barley represents Brahma. It is said that since the old time, the tradition of offering barley during the Havan in worship has been continued. Apart from this, it also symbolizes the food that we should respect, which is the form of Brahma. It is believed that the barley which is sown during Navratri progresses, gives the blessings of the mother. It is said that if barley sown during Navratri sprouts within 2 to 3 days, then it is considered as a good sign. <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-astrologer-consultation\">According to astrologers</a>, the upper and the lower half colors of the barley indicate how the coming year will be for the devotee. That is, having barley of this color means that in the coming year, half the time will be good and half the time will be full of troubles. Apart from this, if the color of barley is green or has become white, then it means that the coming year will be very good.</span></p>\n\n<h3><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Benefits of Keeping Navratri Vrat</span></strong></h3>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">According to the beliefs, keeping the fast during Navratri purifies the mind, body, and soul. During Navratri, we can purify our mind, body, and soul by fasting for 9 days. Fasting these days gives special results. Due to this not only increasing weight can be controlled, but many types of diseases occurring in the body can also be prevented. If fasting is done properly for nine days in Navratri, then it can have many positive results. In the daily hectic lifestyle, unnecessary and uncontrolled eating affects your entire routine and other things. In such a situation, you can organize this lifestyle and diet plan during Navratri fasting. Normally, we may not be able to consume fruits and juices every day with discipline, but during fasting, we do not have any other option. Therefore, consuming plenty of fruits and juices at this time will benefit you.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Eating fruits, dry fruits will also make a difference in your skin and the quality of hair will be better. Fasting not only gives you physical benefits but also gives you spiritual peace and also solves mental stress and other problems. Fasting is a complete package of physical, mental, and spiritual peace. During fasting, you do not get to pay much attention to food and drink other than fruit, thus consuming more fluids. In this way, the lack of water in your body is also fulfilled and the skin remains hydrated. Taking fruits and beverages during fasting helps in flushing out the toxic and harmful substances present in the body. With 9 days of fasting, changing lifestyle, and eating habits will increase your beauty as well as health.</span></p>\n\n<h3><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Precautions to take in Shardiya Navratri</span></strong></h3>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Fasting is very important in all four Navaratri. While we know why it is important, there are certain precautions that one must take in order to avoid any bad omen. Let discuss 9 mistakes that should not be made during Navratri:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Do not cut beard, nails, hair.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Do not make mistakes in worship. However, it is not possible for everyone to be completely right all the time. So, at the end of the puja, apologize to the mother for any unintentional mistakes.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Do not consume meat, alcohol, tamasic food, etc during the Navratri.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Do not use abusive words. That is, do not do any work abusing anyone, insulting anyone, saying harsh words, etc. Since Navratri cleanses your mind and soul, it is better to not indulge in such bad practices.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Do not keep your body and your house dirty. Keep the house clean and take bath daily during Navratri.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Do not sleep during the day. One should not sleep during the day during Navratri. If you have been awake all night for puja, you can sleep. However, do consult a pundit for this.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">Grains and salt should not be consumed in food. Do fasting by eating fruits or dry fruits. Since Navratri Vrat is a form of penance, eat only when you are hungry.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">The rule of fasting should not be broken. That is, if once if you have taken a resolution too fast for nine days, then do not break it in the middle. However, in case of illness or due to some very important reason, you can break the fast by seeking a blessing from the mother.</span></li>\n	<li><span dir=\"LTR\">One should never worship Maa Durga after having food, drinking milk, or juice. Worship of the deity is not done after having a meal. First, offer the meal to them and then consume your food.</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">In Navratri, the mother is worshiped according to the scriptures. According to the belief, the fast observed on these days gives amazing results. Although there is a tradition of fasting for 9 days in Navratri, some people keep fast only on the first day, Ashtami and Navami. Fasting brings physical, mental, and religious benefits. According to the beliefs, keeping the fast during Navratri purifies the mind, body, and soul.</span></p>\n', '2021-09-22 08:22:22', '2021-09-22 08:22:22'),

You will get all the assistance and support from our end and all the rituals would be performed per Vedic rituals at punctual timings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Shanti Path is recited after Antim Sanskar is performed. Shanti Path is done for the peace of the departed soul. It is believed that the soul is attached to its human relations and at times has some desires or wishes unfulfilled. Also, the soul goes through the emotions of sadness while watching its relatives and loved ones sad through death. Shanti Path relives soul from all these sadness and unfulfilled emotions. Shanti Path is a part of the Antim Sanskar ritual but performed at a different time as per the guidance of Panditji. Antim Sanskar Shanti Path is a form of pure prayer for the departed soul&rsquo;s peace and well-being further in spiritual realms.&nbsp;</p>\n', 5100, NULL, '[0,0]', 1, '[]', '[]', '[]', '[2,58,15,33]', '', '2021-07-27 07:07:48'),

This festival begins with Dhanteras. Dhanteras is celebrated on the Trayodashi date of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month. Dhanteras is also known as Dhantrayodashi. Buying gold, silver, and brass items on this day are considered very auspicious.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Story of Dhanteras</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Once Lord Vishnu thought of traveling on Earth. When he told this to Goddess Lakshmi, then she also asked to walk with Lord Vishnu. Then Vishnu told Lakshmi that she can walk with him only when she obeys him. Lakshmi gave her approval to Vishnu. Then both of them set out to roam the earth. On reaching Prithvi Lok (Earth), Vishnu told Lakshmi that she has to stay there and wait for him. He also asked her to keep one thing in mind that Goddess Lakshmi should not look in that direction where they were going. Saying this Lord Vishnu left her.</p>\n\n<p>Lakshmi tried a lot to stop, but her curiosity did not agree. She followed Vishnu and after going a short distance, she saw a mustard field. Going to that mustard field, Goddess Lakshmi plucked flowers to decorate herself. Then Vishnu caught sight of her and he cursed Lakshmi that since she has stolen the flowers, so she will have to serve this farmer for 12 years.</p>\n\n<p>After this curse, Mata Lakshmi went to the farmer&#39;s house disguised as an old woman. The farmer was very poor. When Lakshmi Mata reached there, she told the farmer that she want to stay in his house. Then the farmer said yes after seeing her as an old woman. Mata Lakshmi lived in the farmer&#39;s house and gradually his house was filled with wealth. Soon 12 years passed. After 12 years, Lord Vishnu asked Lakshmi to come back. But then the farmer refused to let her go with Vishnu. Then Goddess Lakshmi told the farmer to clean the house thoroughly on the day of Teras. After cleaning the house, light a lamp of ghee at night. Worship her by keeping a copper urn with money. By doing this she will be close to him throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p>The farmer did the same and with the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi, wealth remained a part of his house. Since then it is believed that <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/deepawali-laxmi-puja\">worshiping Goddess Lakshmi</a> on the day of Teras brings her blessings. Since then this festival of Dhanteras started being celebrated.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Importance of Dhanteras</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The festival of Diwali begins with the worship of Lord Ganesha, Goddess Lakshmi, and Lord Kuber on the occasion of Dhanteras. According to the belief of the Puranas, when the gods and the demons were churning the ocean, at the same time 14 gems came out of the ocean. One of these was Lord Dhanvantari who appeared on the day of Dhantrayodashi with a brass nectar urn in his hand. This is the reason that buying brass items on this day is considered very auspicious.</p>\n\n<p>According to another belief, bringing new things to the house on the day of Dhanteras leads to the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and Lord Kuber, who is considered to be the god of wealth. It is considered good to buy a new broom on this day. The reason for buying a broom on this day is that it is believed to be the abode of goddess Lakshmi.</p>\n\n<p>If you buy a broom on Dhanteras, then it is said that negative energy gets away from the house. Buying gold, silver, and brass items is considered very auspicious.</p>\n\n<p>This Puja proves to be very beneficial. So, <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-booking\">book your puja today</a> and enjoy its merits.

According to Hindu spiritual mythology, it is believed that Kumbh Vivah Sanskar puja helps in overcoming the ill effects of marriage. Kumbh Vivah Sanskar puja was performed to find a spiritual solution over the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/manglik-dosha-nivaran-puja\">Manglik dosh</a> and its adverse effect on human life. Manglik dosh has its bad impact right after the marriage and to have a successful and happy marriage life, overcoming this Dosh, calming down, or removing the Manglik dosh from Kundli is important. </span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">The people who horned on the influence of Mars or the people who have Mars or <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/mangal-grah-shanti-puja-jaap\">Mangal Grah</a> in their Kundali are believed to have Mangal dosh. Such people who are born with Mangal dosh or have Mangal dosh in their Kundali are called Manglik. According to Indian society, Manglik females should always marry the Manglik groom or Manglik males should always have to marry the Manglik bride. Otherwise, if a Manglik person marries a person who does not have Manglik dosh in his Kundali, then that person may face many health or wealth issues after marriage. </span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">There are many ways by which one can reduce the effects of Manglik dosha after marriage but there is no way to destroy the effect of Manglik Dosha. To completely remove the Manglik Dosha from Kundali, the person with Manglik Dosha has to perform Kumbh Vivah Sanskar puja. Kumbh Vivah Sanskar puja removes the Manglik Dosha from the Kundali and the person now can marry any person he/she wants to and will not have any adverse effects on the partner</span></p>\n\n<h3><strong><span dir=\"LTR\">Who can do this puja?</span></strong></h3>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">According to Hindu spirituality and mythology, the person who has Mangal Dosha in his/ her Kundali has to perform the Kumbh Vivah Sanskar puja.

The Kumbh Vivah is a wedding similar to a normal wedding in Hindu culture. The only difference here is instead of a spouse, the person has to do all the sphere and puja with a mud pot. For the chanting of Mantra, <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-booking\">Pandit Ji </a>chants the real Mantra of the wedding and the wedding is performed with all the rituals and real wedding Mantra. </span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">After the wedding, the female has to remove the tie or thread of marriage and has to tie that thread to the mud pot. After that, the girl has to hide or leave the mud pot in the river or any pond. One has to make sure while leaving the mud pot in the river, no one should see or watch her doing that. In that way, all the Manglik Dosha in Kundli of females, get transferred to the mud pot and because mud pot is a nonliving thing, no harm is caused to anyone. So as Manglik Dosha is removed from Kundli, the female can marry any person and have a <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/vivaah-sanskar\">successful marriage</a>. </span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">With Kumbh Vivah Sanskar puja </span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">There will be healthy life of both groom and bride</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">No issue occurs between the marriage life of the groom and bride.

Lord Shiva realized that as long as his wife Vrinda kept praying for her husband&#39;s long life, Jalandhar would be invincible. So Lord Shiva asked Lord Vishnu to undermine Jalandhar. Lord Vishnu taking the form of Jalandhar, deceived Tulsi. Jalandhar then became powerless, and Lord Shiva could kill him.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing this, Tulsi cursed Vishnu and drowned herself in the ocean.

Satyanarayan Vratkatha has been compiled from Rewakhand of Skanda Purana. Another meaning of this is that only Narayan(Lord Vishnu) is the truth in the world, everything else is Maya.

The sages ask Maharishi that what is the simple remedy for liberation from worldly suffering and sadness, and the achievement of the transcendental goal? Maharishi Soot tells the sages that Narada had asked a similar question to Lord Vishnu.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Lord Vishnu, the creator of the universe, said that he would describe such a vrat (fast), by which all men and women of the world will get freedom from sins, by eliminating poverty, man will live happily by floating in the sea of happiness and wealth. By observing this fast of Shri Satyanarayan Bhagwan, all his wishes will be fulfilled. This is the only way to attain salvation in Kali Yuga. Lord Satyanarayan, one day went to a man in the form of an old man.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">After telling him the method of fasting, he became deeply meditative. The poor man decided to observe the fast prescribed by the old man and could not sleep that night. Money and grains started raining in his house. Now he adheres to the fast every month and gets lots of money in alms. When that man, endowed with wealth, fasted regularly every month, many others joined in that fast.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">At the same time, an old woodcutter, who had brought wood from the forest, passed by and decided to fast for Lord Satyanarayan. By thinking like this, he got more money for the wood and grains and bought bananas, ghee, milk, curd, wheat flour, and sugar. He lived happily and attained salvation and went to Baikunth Dham. Then, Lord Vishnu tells the story of those people who performed this fast after listening to the Satyanarayan Katha. </span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">In ancient times, a wise and truthful king named Ulkamukh ruled in Kanakpur. He used to worship Lord Satyanarayana by visiting the temple every day and donating a lot of food, clothes, and money to the poor. His palace was filled with wealth and all his subjects were living happily. A rich merchant approached him and asked him about his secret. The king told him the method of fasting and worship. After listening to the story, the king also gave prasad to the merchant.

It is performed by Siddha priests. In this, the Shivling is kept in the north direction. Devotees sit near Shivling facing east. The abhishekam begins with the Ganges water and after bathing the Shivalinga amidst all the abhishekas with the Ganges water, all the materials required for the Abhishek are offered to the Shivling. In the end, special dishes are offered to the deity, and aarti is performed. The Ganges water collected from the Abhishek is sprinkled on the devotees and also given to drink, which is believed to wash away all sins and diseases. Rudram or &#39;Om Namah Shivaya&#39; is chanted throughout the entire process of Rudrabhishek.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Rudrabhishek means to perform Abhishek of Rudra, that is, to consecrate the Shivling with Rudra mantras. As described in the Vedas, Shiva and Rudra are synonymous with each other. Shiva is called Rudra. Because- rutam-duhkham, dravayati-nasayatitirudrah, that is, being innocent destroys all sorrows. According to our scriptures, the sins committed by us are the cause of our sorrows. Rudrabhishek is considered to be the best way to worship Shiva. Rudra is a form of Shiva. Rudrabhisheka mantras are also described in Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Samveda. It is mentioned in the scriptures and the Vedas that it is extremely beneficial to consecrate Shiva.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Due to Rudrachan and Rudrabhishek, our Patak Karma is also burnt to ashes and Shivatva emerges in the seeker and the devotee receives the blessings of Lord Shiva and all his wishes are fulfilled. It is said that by worshiping only one Sadashiv Rudra, all the deities are automatically worshipped. In Rudrahridayopanishad it is said about Shiva that- Sarvadevatko Rudra: Sarve Deva: Shivatka: That means Rudra is present in the soul of all the gods and all the gods are the soul of Rudra.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Although Rudrabhishek can be done on any day, doing it on Triyodashi Tithi, Pradosh Kaal and Monday is extremely beneficial. Rudrabhishek performed on any day in the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/shravan-maas-ka-adhyatmik-mahatva\">month of Shravan</a> is amazing and gives quick results. The rule of Shiva Abhishek is to collect the necessary materials in advance for this. If possible, a big vessel for water should be anointed with Gangajal. </span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Eleven repetitions of Rudri&#39;s Ekadashini of Rudrashtadhyayi are recited. This is called Laghu Rudra. This is the worship done with Panchamrit. This puja is considered very important. The worship is done by the learned Brahmins by effective mantras and scriptural methods. By this worship, one gets rid of the troubles and negative energy in life. Even if there is no facility for all this, bathing and anointing Mahadev with the following mantras also gives a lot of merits.</span></p>\n\n<p><span dir=\"LTR\">Rudrashtadhyayi is very valuable, Shiva cannot be worshiped without it. It is the main part of the Shuklayjurveda. There are mainly eight chapters in it, but in the last, there is the ninth chapter named Shantyadhyay and also the tenth chapter named Swastiprathnamantradhyay. In its first chapter, there is a total of 10 verses and the first is the Ganeshavahana mantra, in the first chapter there is Shiva Sankalpasukta. There are 22 Vedic verses in the second chapter of which Purusukta (mainly 16 verses) is. Similarly, Aditya Sukta and Vajra Sukta are also included. In the fifth chapter, the most beneficial Rudrasukta is, it has a total of 66 verses. The great Mahamrityunjaya shloka is in the form of the fifth verse of the sixth chapter. In the seventh chapter, there is an Aranyaka Shruti of 7 verses, it is used in atonement havan, etc. The eighth chapter is also called Namak-Chakma which has 24 verses. At the end of Rudrashtadhyayi, 24 mantras of Shantyadhyay pray for peace to various deities, and in Swasti Prarthana Mantradhyay 12 mantras offer Swasti (good luck, well-being, happiness) prayers.</span></p>\n', 15000, NULL, '[0,0]', 1, '[]', '[]', '[4,1,3,5,8]', '[4,8,2,5]', 'Namak chamak rudrabhishek', '2021-10-28 12:03:19'),
