One day in the early morning hours, Veer saw some ladies and kids gather around a heap of wood logs. As he saw them Veer asked&nbsp;his granny,</p>\n\n<p>Veer: Granny, where are these people going and what are they doing?</p>\n\n<p>Granny: Veer, they are preparing for Holika Dahan Pooja.</p>\n\n<p>Veer: What is Holika Dahan Granny; Can you please explain it to me?</p>\n\n<p>Granny: (smile) Ok Son! It has religious values and I will explain it with the famous&nbsp;story behind Holika Dahan.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Story Begins-</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a demon king called Hiranyakashyap. He believed himself to be the real god. He wanted everyone in his kingdom to worship him. Rest all the other gods and goddess should be destroyed. In front of the king&rsquo;s power all the people obeyed him and all the temples and the idols of gods were demolished.</p>\n\n<p>However, there was someone in Hiranyakashapya home, who dare to differ from his thoughts. It was his own son Prahalad, who did not worship him. He used to pray and bow down to the all mighty Lord Vishnu.</p>\n\n<p>This act of his own son made Hiranyakashyap very angry. The level of anger reaches to this extent that he decided to kill him. As disobedience of Prahalad revokes the people of his kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>To get his son killed he called his demon sister Holika. Sister Holika has a vardaan(boon)&nbsp;that she cannot be burnt alive in the fire. Therefore she decided to use this magical power of her to kill Prahalad. One evening she loved Prahalad and artfully she brought him to her lap. Then she sat over the huge bonfire, thinking that Prahalad will die soon and she will come back safely.</p>\n\n<p>Veer: Then what happened Granny? What happened to Prahalad?</p>\n\n<p>Granny: (Smile) But, something unexpected happens, God took favour of Prahalad, as he was worshipping lord Vishnu, always with his pure heart. On the other hand, Holika died as she had the ill intension of killing a small child, just because he was worshipping the real power &ldquo;God&rdquo;!</p>\n\n<p>In the end, his father was shocked as Holika&rsquo;s powers did not work. And Prahalad came out safely while he was chanting &ldquo;Lord Vishnu&rdquo;, who saved him while wicked Holika has burned away.</p>\n\n<p>So what did you learned from this story Veer?</p>\n\n<p>Veer: ( Excited) That we should always worship god</p>\n\n<p>Granny: Of course and also&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>Good always beats evil</strong>&rdquo;. So you should always help others and never use your strength to harm others.</p>\n\n<p>Importance of the story : We do the bonfire in the evening a day before the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/tag/holi\">Holi festival</a>, to embark the presence of Goodness and humanity while remembering Prahalad and Lord Vishnu.</p>\n\n<p>Veer: (Politely) Granny can I&nbsp;also go and see the bonfire in the evening?</p>\n\n<p>Granny hugged Veer and nod her head in confirmation.</p>\n', '2021-02-04 15:56:27', '2021-04-23 06:12:48'),

Not only is it unique in its way, but also acts as a source of confidence and peace for many of us. Puja is one of the most integral parts of this belief system and is a procedure that has been followed for ages.</p>\n\n<p>We perform pujas every day and special pujas on festivals and important occasions of our life. <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/benefits-of-online-pandit-ji\">Performing puja</a> on such days not only makes it memorable but is also auspicious at the same. While the elders understand the significance, the younger generation might find it hard to understand why we need to perform puja.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the roots of our faith, the bond between the devotee and the deity becomes stronger, and one gets to learn the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/pandit-ji-for-puja-near-me\">importance of puja</a>. However, we tried to answer the most common question asked &ndash; &ldquo;what is puja and what is it important.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Read on to learn and discover how puja can be beneficial for yourself and your family.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Puja?</h3>\n\n<p>Puja or also written as &quot;pooja&quot; is derived from Sanskrit, which means &quot;adoration&quot;, &quot;reverence&quot;, and &quot;worship.&quot; The word is also defined in various ways by the pundits and the acharyas. As per one interpretation, the word &quot;puja&quot; comprises the two letters &quot;pa&quot; and &quot;ja.&quot;&nbsp; The letter &quot;pa&quot; stands for repetition of the <a href=\"/what-is-puja-and-why-is-it-important\">Hindu sacred</a> texts ceremonially, and &quot;ja&rdquo; refers to the recitation.</p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, puja is a ritual that is followed every day in most Hindu households. Offerings are made to the deity, to receive blessings in return. During the puja, the devotee repeats or japs the sacred chants which connect him/her to God and helps attain peace.</p>\n\n<h3>Puja in the morning</h3>\n\n<p>Daily puja is mostly performed in the morning as these hours are known to be sacred, auspicious, and fruitful. As puja involves the recitation of <a href=\"/significance-of-bell-in-a-temple\">slokas or mantras</a>, performing the same during the calm and peaceful morning hours is considered apt. Pundits also believe that the Godly bodies are very receptive to the prayers performed during the mornings.</p>\n\n<h3>How to prepare yourself for daily puja?</h3>\n\n<p>Most of the homes have a special place for performing puja. If there is none, you can pick a place that is free from distractions and is peaceful.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Use a fresh piece of cloth or a mat. Sit facing East or North.</li>\n	<li>Clean the space as well as the idols by sprinkling just a few water drops. You need to use a separate cloth to clean the idols and apply kumkum.</li>\n	<li>You need to place two dreams (oil lamp) on both sides of the mandapam. One deepam should face the sun i.e. the east and the other should face north. Once done, light the lamps using cow ghee, or oil.</li>\n	<li>After you light the lamps, you can recite stotras or slokas as per your convenience or tradition.</li>\n	<li>While reciting the slokas, you can decorate the idols of the god with flowers, offer naivedyam and incense sticks.</li>\n	<li>You can then end the puja with aarti. While performing aarti, you need to ring the bell as it is believed that it &ldquo;wakens&rdquo; the gods.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Why is it important to perform puja?</h3>\n\n<p>Performing pooja every day not only renews your faith but can also help bring your family together for an auspicious start of the day. There are many benefits of doing puja every day and a few of them are listed below.</p>\n\n<h3>Helps start your day on a very positive note</h3>\n\n<p>Performing puja every day brings contentment and peace to your soul. As you start your day with slokas or mantras and puja, you are filling your mind with positivity. Such a routine helps you stay calm the whole day, enabling you to take care of various chores and challenges with confidence.</p>\n\n<h3>Brings your family together</h3>\n\n<p>When you perform puja with all the members of your family together, it becomes a ritual over time. This way, your family comes together every morning, where no one is distracted and is very happy and thankful for being united.</p>\n\n<h3>Generates positive vibrations</h3>\n\n<p>The chants and the mantras fill the house with very positive vibrations. As you ensure to clean the house and take bath before performing puja, the house is clean. When you light the camphor or incense sticks, their magical aroma fills the house with harmony. <a href=\"/importance-of-kanak-dhara-stotra\">The positive vibrations</a> created flow through the house for the rest of the day as well. You can increase the same by playing audios of slokas during the morning and evening every day.</p>\n\n<h3>Helps you face problems and handle challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Puja improves our focus and reaffirms our faith in god. It helps us stay balanced and calm, and gets rid of negative thoughts, fear, temper, etc, preparing us for challenges. It increases your faith to remain strong and brings inner peace. The reaffirmation you get by performing puja and talking to god act as your pillars of strength.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Performing puja every day helps you lead a balanced, peaceful, and worry-free life. You can also perform special pujas at home for various occasions. These special pujas or homams are done as per the Vedic rituals and are performed by purohits, and are performed for one deity in particular by invoking Agni. If you have a special occasion or wish to perform a special puja/Homam at home, ensure to approach a <a href=\"/the-story-behind-holika-dahan\">Vedic pundit</a> for the same.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '2021-03-19 09:53:13', '2021-04-09 04:59:53'),

By praying for 15-20 minutes daily, a person starts connecting with his inner peace and gradually troubles come to an end. Prayer develops positive energy in the mind and the body becomes healthy.</p>\n\n<p>When doing a Puja your body, mind, and consciousness are all united and centered on one thing. We recite the deity&#39;s name with complete admiration and respect. It&rsquo;s a perfect way to discipline yourself and make your mind focused. If one is filled by stressful emotions, burdened with pressure or difficulties, or actually cannot understand which direction to transform, then a Puja will aid in calming the mind and finding a path that was previously blocked. Your negativity will have a serious effect on your house and your loved ones too. So not only does a Puja benefit you but also your surroundings.</p>\n\n<h3>Daily Puja Time</h3>\n\n<p>Veda recommends doing puja five times a day. The first one is the early morning at 4:30 AM in the Brahmi muhurtham, followed by puja at 9 AM and then a Mid-day puja at 12:00 PM. After which you have to let the deity relax. Later, perform Sandhya puja again in the evening between 4:30 PM and 6:00 PM. At last, we have Shayana puja at 9:00 PM to bring God to sleep. Since the current lifestyle does not encourage one to do the same, it is advisable to do pooja at least twice a day, one in the morning and then again in the evening.</p>\n\n<p>Brahma Muhurta is ideal for Sandhya Vandan, Meditation, Prayer, and Study. According to Vedas, the Brahma Muhutahm is dawn right before sunrise. Therefore, this time can differ from different locations and seasons. Similarly, Sandhya Puja is before sunset. Prayer, Meditation, Kirtan, Yajna, and Aarti are <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pooja-booking\">five parts of this Puja</a>. A devotee follows it by themselves or at the temple.</p>\n\n<h3>How to Perform Daily Puja</h3>\n\n<p>As per the Vedic scriptures, performing the regular pooja in the morning hours benefits the individual. The morning&#39;s quiet hours help maintain concentration and build a clear mind, increasing the person&#39;s aura. The next query in line is, how can one complete the morning puja?</p>\n\n<p>First, take a bath. Wear clean cotton clothes before you do your pooja. To gain concentration, with your preferred god in mind, sit facing east or north to meditate. Wash the puja room and light lamps(Diya). Start with the reciting hymns for <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/ganesh-puja\">Lord Ganesa</a>. Say shlokas that refer to your house deity. Make sure you clean the deity.</p>\n\n<p>You can recite the mantra while offering flowers. Light the dhoops sticks and spread the vapors throughout the house. Based on how much time you have, you can continue reading the shlokas. Give naivedyam(नैवेद्यम) to God - it may be fruit, honey, or something you feel like offering to God. Perform aarti when reciting similar verses.</p>\n\n<p>For Evening Puja, it should be done after the sunsets and before dark. Light lamps( Diya) in the evening. You can use either ghee or oil. One should never play conch or bells in the evening worship. In this time the Gods and Goddesses go to sleep. Flowers etc. need not be broken in the evening. For worshipping, either collect them first or it would be best not to include them in this time of worship. The place of worship should be veiled in the night so that there is no disturbance while God is sleeping. Once you shut the Puja place, open it at dawn.</p>\n\n<h3>Some of the common items used in Puja are:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Lamp oil</li>\n	<li>Cotton wicks for the lamps</li>\n	<li>Japa mala</li>\n	<li>Mat to sit on while performing puja</li>\n	<li>Puja utensils</li>\n	<li>Flowers and a flower bowl to hold them</li>\n	<li>Dhoop sticks and a stand to put them.</li>\n	<li>Aarti puja Diya or spoons to perform aarti</li>\n	<li>Camphor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Things not to do while performing Puja</h3>\n\n<p>Negative thoughts, debate, conversation, sleep, food, travel, any kind of noise etc.</p>\n\n<p>should be avoided. The Puja is made to lighten our mood and create a positive outlook towards our lives. The same goes for one&rsquo;s physical appearance. Sitting for Puja in dirty attire with unhygienic is not allowed. Make sure you take a bath before every Puja and clean the place of worship. You should be wary of the direction you sit or perform the Puja/ Aarti. Directions like South is not appropriate for worship. The puja and aarti should end before 12 noon. The puja or aarti is not performed between 12 PM and 4 PM. It is considered prohibited by the Vedas. Bathrooms and Toilets should be away from Puja&#39;s place. You can ask priests to know more about the prohibition during pujas. For example, an incensed stick is not used in havans. It is replaced with dhoop or Diya.</p>\n\n<p>Now you have all the information you need to know before doing a Puja. While everything takes time, so do prayers. Regardless of your busy lifestyle, always be regular and consistent with your prayer. Slowly but surely, you will see definite results.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '2021-03-19 09:53:13', '2021-04-10 08:18:10'),

This is to ensure the success of any work. To perform a task smoothly and smoothly, it is necessary to worship Shree Ganesh for the first time. That is why in Sanatan Dharma, the beginning of any work starts with the worship of Shree Ganesh. Any devotee who fasts or worships Lord Ganesha surely receives the blessings of the Lord and the desired fruit. Some people also write Shree Ganeshaya Namah at the time of the inauguration.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from this, it is also a custom that Sri Ganesh is worshipped before all the deities. Most people know about this custom, but very few people know why <a href=\"/product/ganesh-puja\">Ganesha is worshipped first.</a> While many people don&rsquo;t know this, it has an interesting story. Actually, in order to avoid any hindrance in worship, rituals, and work, Lord Ganesha is worshipped first. His blessing is obtained before beginning any important task.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Story</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Once a dispute arose among all the gods on who should be worshipped first before any ceremony on the earth. All the gods started to discuss the reasons why they should be prayed first and claimed themselves the best. Narad Muni, a divine Sage, after seeing this situation advised all the gods to go to Mt Kailash to Lord Shiva. He asks them to take the help of Lord Shiva and resolve the dispute. Thus, all the gods reached near Lord Shiva. He saw the quarrel between them and then decided to give them a task in order to test them. He organized a competition for all the deities. He asked them to sit in their respective <em>vahana</em> and take a round of the whole universe. In this competition, whoever revolves around the universe and reaches them first, will be considered as the god to be the first worshipped.</p>\n\n<p>All the gods set out for their journey with their vehicles. Lord Ganesh was also a part of this competition. However, Ganesha, unlike the other gods who orbited the universe, completed the seven rounds by orbiting his <a href=\"/product/mahamritunjay-jaap\">parents Shiva-Parvati</a> and stood with folded hands in front of him. When all the deities returned after doing their task, Lord Shiva declared Shri Ganesh victorious in the competition. All the gods were astonished to hear this decision and asked Shiva to explain the reason behind it. Then Shivji told him that the parents have been given the highest position in all the universe and all the worlds, which are considered to be higher than the gods and all the creation. Then all the gods agreed with this decision of Lord Shiva. Since then, Lord Ganesh was first considered to be revered.</p>\n\n<p>This is the reason that Lord Ganesha began to be worshipped among the gods for the first time due to the use of his sharp intellect. Since then, Ganesh Vandana is considered auspicious before every important event or festival.&nbsp; Most people remember Lord Ganesh before starting any auspicious work.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>How to Establish Lord Ganesh In your House</strong></h2>\n\n<p>You can go to the market and select the idol of Ganapati and then bring the statue home. While purchasing the idol of Ganesha, make sure that his vehicle, a mouse, is also there. The idol should be such that, in which, Ganesha is giving blessings with his hand i.e. one hand should be in <em>Varada</em> posture. Also, keep in mind that they have modak in other hands. If he does not have modak in his hand, then worshipping such an idol of Lord Ganesh is considered inauspicious.</p>\n\n<p>Before bringing him home, clean the place of worship thoroughly and sprinkle Ganga water throughout the house. Then by laying a red cloth on a clean area, place Akshat i.e. rice on it, and install Ganapati on top of them. After this, give Lord Ganesh a bath with Ganges water with the help of Durva grass and offer yellow clothes to the Lord. With this, you can also offer moli as a garment.&nbsp; After bathing, offer Akshat and flowers by applying Tilak to Lord Ganpati with roli and offer dear modak. After this, perform Aarti and Kirtan. <a href=\"/product/bodysoul-meditation-incense-sticks\">Do keep Panchameva daily in Prasad.</a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How to do Vandana</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Before worshipping, sit in a straight posture and collect all the materials: flowers, incense, lamp, camphor, roli, molly red, sandalwood, modak, etc. Wednesday is believed to be dedicated to Lord Ganesha. Some people also keep fast to get the blessings of Lord Ganesha. Tulsi Dal and Tulsi leaves should not be offered to Lord Ganesh. However, Durva grass can be offered to him after plucking from a clean place and washing it. Modak (laddus) is very much loved by Lord Ganesha, so offer him prasad made of pure ghee.</p>\n\n<p>Read the mantra of Shri Ganesha, &ldquo;<a href=\"/product/griha-pravesh\">Shri Gan Ganpataye Namah</a> &rdquo; 108 times, to yields good results. Sitting near the Puja site with joining both your hands and reciting a mantra to get auspicious results. Lord Shiva including Shree Ganesh and the entire Shiva family including Gauri, Nandi, Karthikeya should be worshipped through the Shodashopchar method.

While meditating on Shree Ganesh, one should be pure and happy with the spiritual mind. After worship, remember all the deities. Always welcome and worship them in the same manner and spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Lord Ganesha takes a formidable form in the path of obstacles to remove all the obstacles of his devotees.

It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya started it, but according to some legends, Kumbha started from the beginning of the sea churning. It has been told in the scriptures that the year of the earth is the day of the gods, so every twelve years, Kumbh is organized again at one place. The twelve years of the gods come after 144 years of the earth. It is believed that after 144 years, Kumbh is organized in heaven, so that year Mahakumbh is held on earth. Prayagraj has been designated as the real place for Mahakumbh.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>History of Kumbh Mela</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The Kalash is called Kumbh which means pitcher. This festival is related to the nectar(amrit) in urn which came out during the sea churning. Once Indra and the gods fell weak due to the curse of Maharishi Durvasa, the demon who attacked and defeated the gods. All the gods together approached Lord Vishnu and told him everything. Then <a href=\"/product/satyanarayan-katha\">Lord Vishnu</a> advised the gods to go against the demons and churn the Kshira Sagar and extract the nectar(<em>Amrit</em>). At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity engaged in an attempt to extract the nectar by making a treaty with the demons. At the behest of the deities, Indra&#39;s son &#39;Jayant&#39; flew into the sky carrying the Amrit Kalash. The demons chased Jayant to fetch the nectar and after a while, they caught Jayant in the midway and there was a fierce battle between Dev and Demon for 12 days to take possession of the Amrit Kalash.</p>\n\n<p>Some of its drops fell in the three rivers of the earth. Kumbh is organized at the place where these drops fell. The names of those three rivers are Ganga, Godavari and Kshipra. The nectar that came out in the churning fell at these places- Haridwar, Prayagraj, Ujjain and Nashik. Hence the Kumbh Mela has been held at these four places only after every three years. After 12 years, this fair returns to its first place. This is the reason that the <a href=\"/product/kumbh-vivah-sanskaar-puja\">Kumbh Mela</a> is celebrated at these four places. Kumbh is divided into 4 parts. For example, if the first Kumbh is in Haridwar, then after 3 years, the second Kumbh is in Prayagraj and then the third Kumbh is in Ujjain after 3 years, and then after 3 years, the fourth Kumbh is in Nashik.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>When Does Khubh Mela Occur?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Jupiter and the Sun planets play an important role in deciding the date and place of the Kumbh Mela. The location and date of the fair are determined only by entering the zodiac signs of Jupiter and the Sun.</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>In the year in which <em>Brihaspati</em> enters <em>Kumbh Rashi</em>(Aquarius) and the <em><a href=\"/product/navgraha-shanti-puja-with-jaap\">Surya Grah</a></em> enters <em>Mesh Rashi</em>, then in that year, Kumbh Mela is held in the city of Dev Haridwar. It falls in the Magh month of the Hindi calendar.</li>\n	<li>The year Kumbh Mela takes place in Prayagraj is the year when <em>Surya Grah</em> enters <em>Makar Rashi </em>(Capricorn) and<em> Brihaspati </em>enters<em> Mesh Rashi </em>or<em> Vrishab Rashi</em>. It takes<em> </em>place in Chaitra, the first month of the Hindu calendar.</li>\n	<li>In the year in which the <em>Surya Grah</em> and <em>Jupiter(Brihaspati Grah</em>) enter the same <em>Singh Rashi</em>, the Kumbh Mela is held in Nashik, Maharashtra in that year. Nashik<em> </em>Kumbha takes place in Bhadrapada month.</li>\n	<li>In the year when <em>Brihaspati</em> enters <em>Singh Rashi</em>) and Sun God enters <em>Mesh Rashi</em>, then this Kumbh Mela takes place in Ujjain. It is also called Simhastha Kumbh because it is related to the <em>Singh Rashi</em> sign. Simhastha Kumbh takes place in the month of Vaishakh.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><strong>Festival of Kumbh</strong></h2>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Kumbh in Haridwar: Ardh Kumbh is also organized in Haridwar and Prayag at a gap of six years between the two Kumbh festivals. Haridwar is located under the Shivalik mountain of the Himalayan mountain range. In ancient texts, Haridwar is also known by the names of Tapovan, Mayapuri, Gangadwar and Mokshdwar. The religious significance of Haridwar is huge. It is a major pilgrimage centre for Hindus.</li>\n	<li>Kumbh in Prayag: Prayag Kumbha has special significance because it is held after 12 years at the confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and <a href=\"/product/saraswati-puja\">Saraswati</a>. Prayagraj&#39;s Kumbh Mela has the highest importance among all the fairs.</li>\n	<li>Kumbh in Nashik: Once in 12 years Simhastha Kumbh Mela is held in Nashik and Trimbakeshwar. Joti ling, one of the 12 in India, is located in the holy city called Trimbakeshwar. This place is located at a distance of 38 km from Nashik and the Godavari river originated from here as well.</li>\n	<li>Kumbh in Ujjain: This festival takes place in Ujjain on the day of Kartik Amavasya. Apart from Ujjain, the remaining are Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Kashi, Kanchipuram and Dwarka. It is said that <a href=\"/product/mahamritunjay-jaap\">Lord Shiva</a> killed the Tripura demon in Ujjain.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to religious belief, all the sins of people who worship devoutly in Kumbh are cut off and they get salvation. Kumbh bathing is considered to be special because it is believed that on this day the gates of heaven worlds are opened on this day and thus bathing on this day gives the soul easy access to the higher realms.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Rules to Follow in Kumbh Mela</strong></h2>\n\n<p>If you are going to have a Kumbh bath, keep in mind that the bath has a special rule. If you are going to have a bath in Kumbh or a bath in a holy river even on normal days, then some things should be taken care of.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Pray to the river before taking a bath, then put on a foot and then a flower.

Ganesh Chaturthi is also known as Ganesh Utsav and Vinayaka Chaturthi. According to the Hindu calendar, Lord Ganesha was born on the fourth day of the duty date in the month of Bhadrapada. This year, the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated on 10 September 2021. Lord Shiva and Parvati&#39;s son Ganesha is said to be the god of wisdom, wisdom, prosperity and good fortune. While Ganesh Chaturthi festival is celebrated all over India, but widely in Maharashtra. During the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi, which is celebrated for 11 days, people keep Lord Ganesha in the house for 10 days and perform Ganesh Visarjan on the 11th day. On the Ganesh Utsav, people greet each other with the warm wishes of <a href=\"/product/ganesh-puja\">Ganesh Chaturthi</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Story Behind Ganesh Chaturthi</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Goddess Parvati was the creator of Ganapati. In the absence of Lord Shiva, he used his sandalwood paste to make Ganesha and put it to bathe. While he was gone, Lord Shiva fought with Ganesha and did not allow him to enter as per the orders of his mother. Enraged, Lord Shiva beheaded Ganesha. When Parvati saw this scene, she took the form of Goddess Kali and threatened to destroy the world. This alarmed everyone and he requested Lord Shiva to find a remedy and pacify the wrath of Goddess Kali. Shiva then immediately ordered all his followers to find a child, whose mother carelessly went back towards her child and brought her head. The first child seen by the followers was an elephant and they ordered, cut off his head and brought it to Lord Shiva. <a href=\"/product/mahamritunjay-jaap\">Lord Shiva</a> immediately placed the head on Ganesha&#39;s body and brought it back to life. Mother Kali&#39;s wrath subsided and Goddess Parvati was once again overwhelmed. All God blesses Ganesha and today is the day celebrated for the same reason.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Other Interesting Story of Ganesh Chaturthi</strong></h2>\n\n<p>There are many rituals and customs during this festival that people observe - a popular tradition after the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi is to avoid seeing <a href=\"/product/chandra-grah-shanti\">the moon</a>. Seeing the moon on Ganesh Chaturthi creates a mithya dosham or mithya stigma, which means a false accusation of stealing something. According to mythology, on the fourth day of the month of Bhadrapada (Chaturthi), Lord Ganesha was returning home with Mooshak, the moon god Chandra started laughing loudly and commenting on his stomach and small rat. To teach Moon a lesson, Lord Ganesha cursed him that no light would ever fall on him. Thus, the moon disappeared into the sky. Moon and other gods apologized and God bowed. However, once cursed it cannot be fully withdrawn. It can only be reduced. So Lord Ganesha reduced his curse and said that whichever day one sees the moon, on the fourth day of the Hindu month, Bhadrapada will be cursed with falsehood.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Ganesh Chaturthi Preparations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Preparation for Ganesh Chaturthi starts about a month before the festival. This festival lasts for about ten days (from Bhadrapada Shud Chaturthi to Anant Chaturdashi). On the first day, a clay idol of Lord Ganesha is installed in the houses. <a href=\"/product/bhoomi-pujan\">The houses</a> are decorated with flowers. The temple witnesses the visit of a large number of devotees. Worship is done and bhajans are performed. Often, families gather to celebrate the festival. Locals organize and arrange pandals and install large idols of Lord Ganesha to celebrate the festival with friends and family. On the last day of ceremonies, the idol of Lord Ganesha is taken to the streets. People demonstrate their enthusiasm and joy in the form of dancing and singing on the streets with the idol. The idol is finally immersed in a river or sea. On this day, a large number of devotees express their happiness and offer their prayers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>During this festival, people sing devotional songs, dance, fast, bed in their homes, and burst firecrackers. People start the day worshiping and donate new clothes to worship Ganesha. To perform any type of worship requires cleanliness and prerequisite of body and mind. The idol of a Ganesha is bathed in perfumed water (abhishekam) and then covered with a new saffron cloth. It is securely placed on a pedestal and adorned with sandalwood paste and a garland of fresh flowers.</li>\n	<li>Modak, rice or flour dumplings filled with grated jaggery, coconut and dry fruits, is a popular food of the festival and is the main &#39;prasad&#39; offered to Lord Ganesha. Considered to be the favorite dessert of God, other delicacies of this festival include Appam, Peda, Sundal, Barfi, Laddu, and Karanji.</li>\n	<li>Lord Ganesha is worshiped with sixteen rituals. <a href=\"/online-pooja-booking\">The prayers</a> are followed by &quot;Puranic Mantras&#39;&#39;, which are chanted during Ganesh Chaturthi Puja. Some of the popular Ganesh Puja mantras sung by devotees on this day are &#39;Ganesh Shubh Laabh mantra&rsquo;, &#39;Ganesh Gayatri Mantra&#39;, and &#39;Vakratunda Ganesh Mantra&#39; among others. After this, the devotees bow before Lord Ganesha and pray for the good of all. They also apologize for any mistake and ask God to cleanse their sins.</li>\n	<li>The Ganesh Chaturthi ritual concludes with the aarti of Lord Ganesha. Aarti is performed twice that day, once in the morning and again in the evening. On the 11th day of the festival, Ganesh Visarjan is celebrated, in which the idol is immersed in water.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Ganesh Chaturthi Pooja Vidhi</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Ganesh worship begins by installing a clay statue of Lord Ganesha in your home. Various dishes are cooked for food-to-be-offered (bhoga). The idol is bathed in pure water and then decorated with flowers. Jyoti is lit and then the aarti begins. At this time various hymns, and mantras are chanted. It is believed that by chanting mantras with full devotion, the idol has vital life. It is also believed that during this period, Ganesha visits the home of his devotees and brings prosperity and good luck with them. For this reason, this day is celebrated as a very auspicious day.</p>\n\n<p>Although a large number of sweets are offered to Lord Ganesha during worship, Modak is known as the favorite dessert of God and hence it is one of the main dishes made on this day. Other dishes include Karanji, Laddu, Barfi and Ped. <a href=\"/who-is-the-first-worshipped-among-god\">Worshiping</a> Ganpati Yantra will give you a lot of success in life.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '2021-04-10 08:18:10', '2021-04-10 08:18:10'),

From the Vedic period till today, it has been a tradition to observe auspicious times before performing any work. The work done in the auspicious time is done smoothly, it is the word of sages and scholars which is also empirical.</p>\n\n<p>What is the importance of Muhurta, and how the auspicious Muhurta is selected, and what information about the goodness of the day, date, constellation, Karan, etc. is an important contributor? Let&rsquo;s know what determines the nature of the auspicious and inauspiciousness of all these constituent elements of the Muhurta and what direction and condition the work gets from it. According to the folk tradition, choosing the auspicious time to start any auspicious task is called Muhurta selection. To ensure the accomplishment of work, Muhrat is optimal to start your work in an auspicious time that remains in the hearts of all. The practice of watching Muhurta has been going on for thousands of years.</p>\n\n<p>It is but natural that the work done in this inauspicious time will either not be completed or will be delayed or with disruption or it may or may not happen. But those tasks have negative energy surrounding them that cannot guarantee that the work done in that time will be completed or there is no interference in it. But it is true that instead of choosing an inauspicious time, it will be good to choose the auspicious time, because if a good time does not change our fate, then it can make the path of success easier.</p>\n\n<p>The Hindu calendar also has only 12 months in a year. The month is also 30 days only. The full moon ends on the full moon day. Purnimanta month is prevalent in North India. At the same time, Amavasya ends Amant month. Amant has more recognition in the south. The first date of the month is Pratipada. Then there are fourteen dates till Dwitiya, Tritiya, etc. Chaturdashi.

Why do</p>\n\n<p>Kundali and its consultation hold an important part in our lives?</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What is Astrology?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>It was due to these questions that man began to see, examine and understand the planets and stars of the sky. Soon, people around started understanding the celestial movements. People began to relate the events around them to the activities of planets and constellations and thus became a scripture, which we now <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/category/astrologer-consultation\">call astrology</a>. According to Vedic knowledge, astrology can be defined as:</p>\n\n<p>&#39;<em>Jyotishan Suryadi Grahananam Bodhakam Shastra</em>&#39;</p>\n\n<p>This means that the science that gives knowledge of the planets (planets, constellations, comets, etc.) and time are called astrology i.e. the science which provides astrology. While today astrology is common, it is perceived to have started in India. In a way, it helps us navigate our daily life emotionally, physically, and financially. In this sense, it sits closer to spirituality and philosophy than astronomy.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why are Vedic Zodiac Signs important?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Just as the land is divided into several parts and the education of geography is given easily, similarly, astronomy has also been divided into 360 parts. They are categorized into 12 different zodiac signs and have 27 constellations too. Each zodiac located in the zodiac cycle is 30 degrees. The zodiac is actually the name of a special shape and appearance of the constellation of the planets in the sky. There is neither a scorpion nor a lion in the sky, the Maharishi has named the zodiac signs on the basis of familiar objects, keeping in mind the symmetry of the star clusters to facilitate identification. To understand precisely, four parts of each nakshatra are called Charan. The Moon transits in every zodiac and for two days. After that, it reaches a different amount. This pattern is given priority by Indian astrology.</p>\n\n<p>Each zodiac has its own shape and each zodiac has been named on the basis of this shape. All the zodiac signs have their own different significance. Your Vedic zodiac sign says a lot about you. Through these, your nature, personality, and habits can be easily known. Due to the influence of the constellations, zodiacs,&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/navgraha-shanti-puja-with-jaap\">nine planets</a>- qualities and defects can be predicted of the person. Due to different elements in <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/tag/astrologer-consultation-online\">Vedic astrology</a>, 12 zodiac signs are divided into four parts. These include water signs, fire signs, air signs,s and earth signs. According to astrology, there are 12 zodiac signs, these zodiac signs are named as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Aries</li>\n	<li>Taurus</li>\n	<li>Gemini</li>\n	<li>Cancer</li>\n	<li>Leo</li>\n	<li>Virgo</li>\n	<li>Libra</li>\n	<li>Scorpio</li>\n	<li>Sagittarius</li>\n	<li>Capricorn</li>\n	<li>Aquarius</li>\n	<li>Pisces</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In Vedic astrology, the horoscope is calculated based on the lunar sign. At the time of our birth, when the Moon(<a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/chandra-grah-shanti\">Chandra Grah</a>) rises in the sky, the zodiac sign is called our lunar sign. The sun-based zodiac is considered important in Western astrology. In this astrology, the signs that are with the sun(Surya Grah) at the time of birth are your sun sign. In Vedic astrology, the horoscope of a person is prepared by the position and calculation of the 12 zodiacs, 12 bhavas, and 27 nakshatras present in the horoscope. With the help of this horoscope, the important points, accomplishments, incidents of people&#39;s lives are known.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why is Astrology Important?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>People have been continuously trying to calm their curiosity. It has been continuously trying to solve the problems of creation, this effort has been called science today. In the same way, what can humans do next in their life? Why is it happening in life? He is curious to know the answers to these questions. Answers to these questions can be found through astrology. The planetary system in the human body is directly related to the outer solar system.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the effects resulting from their study can be interpreted.</p>\n\n<p>The importance of astrology can be clearly seen in our daily lives. We get the knowledge of festivals, festivals, etc. only by astrological calculations. The wide impact of astrology can be seen in the rural life of India. That is why even a farmer knows in which nakshatra the rain is good. When they should sow seeds. With the use of astrology, life can be reduced, the obstacles of life can be removed. More success can be achieved with less effort.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Western astrology, Vedic astrology observes the birth chart of a person. It follows the constellation zodiac, in which the horoscope is placed as a reference for a fixed point. While the Earth completes the four revolutions of the Sun in a year and the axis of the Earth also turns around every day and it takes many years to complete a cycle. Hence it is becoming very prevalent in the last few years.</p>\n\n<p>Astrology is not a way to change the future, nor does it claim to describe future events in the same way. It only tells about the positive and negative trends in an independent horoscope based on the position of the planets and after knowing this one can work on the negative areas to reduce these negative effects.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why take Online Consultation of an Astrologer?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>As we discussed, Kundali of every person is unique and caters to only that person. Unlike Western Zodiac signs, the navgrah (nine planets) influence a person&rsquo;s sign and thus decide their future. Thus, using a generalized platform for asking your questions might not work. An astrologer has expertise in calculating and foretelling the future on the basis of Kundali. Also, in the absence of correct knowledge of Astrology, the common people start trying</p>\n\n<p>Astrological remedies at the advice of anyone. But such tried measures can prove to be harmful at times. They can create more disturbance and bring unwanted trouble or increase your problems. Therefore, consulting with an astrologer helps in receiving correct advice and following good remedies to calm your doshas.</p>\n', '2021-05-06 07:13:49', '2021-05-06 07:13:49'),
(14, 'Online Pandit Booking', 'online-pandit-booking', 'online-pandit-booking.jpg', 'online-panditji-booking.jpg', '[4]', '[11]', 'Text', '<p>In today&#39;s run-of-the-mill life, where a person is barely able to find time for his family, he is unable to find time to remember and <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/who-is-the-first-worshipped-among-god\">worship his God</a>, to do puja. And if a person thinks of organizing a puja havan at home, when needed, it seems like a huge task. A lot of work comes in front of you in organizing this kind of event. Like first <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-ji\">finding Pandit Ji,</a> making a list of Puja material, collecting whole Puja material by visiting different places in the market, then reaching home to arrange pure wood for havan including havan kund, bringing flower garland, leaves, etc. All these mobilizations start to look crooked.</p>\n\n<p>Recall a story of Srimad Bhagavad Gita- it is the story of the child Dhruva. In a nutshell, the story tells that people worship deities for fulfilling the requests and desires. The common man&#39;s mind is like a child Dhurva. Everything that happens is according to the wish of God. A man approaches God so that he can gain salvation by devotion to God.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Who is Pandit?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Today, when the whole world has turned into a global village, why shouldn&rsquo;t the convenience of our Vedic traditions, rituals, rituals of religious worship etc. be made easy through modern resources? It cannot be denied that since ancient times, kings have arranged havans in India for the welfare of the general public. Earlier, there was a mutual guru-disciple tradition or the priest as an advisor in the King&rsquo;s court. Pandit means Dash or skilled in a piece of particular knowledge. Other terms like scholar or master can also be used to describe him. A pundit is a person who has knowledge of a particular discipline. In ancient India, the great scholar of Vedas and scriptures etc. was called <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/online-pandit-ji\">Pandit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Presently this relationship started to weaken with the change of time, due to which there are many reasons like - migration, urbanization, effects of globalization, etc. But still, people who believe in Hinduism are fulfilling their religious needs in some way, but are not satisfied with all of them. The main reasons for this are lack of knowledge of Vedic culture, availability of qualified pundits, pure worship materials, etc. Due to which all these religious events are not fully successful and devotees do not get the full benefit of them.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Why do you need Pandit?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Our Hindu scriptures prescribe certain objects for worship. However, people who have started doing Puja or do havan rarely, might not know the correct information. Simultaneously, many Puja samagri can create confusion. For example, Betel nut is so important in Hindu religious rituals that worship does not begin without it. It is worth noting that there are two types of betel nuts and both are separate items. The betel nut which is eaten is large and round. On the other hand, the betel nut of Pooja is small in shape and has a peak at the top. Along with this, the floor of the betel nut is very flat, which makes the installation work easy. In the <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/category/hindu-puja\">Indian Puja</a> Vidhan, the invocation of the gods or the start of the yagna, every work is started with the installation by placing betel nuts and betas on the sides of the pan. Now, the person who can differentiate between the correct type of betel nut will be Pandit.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a Puja place at home also has very restrictive rules that the person should follow. While God can be pleased by doing Puja and at the same time it also gives peace of mind. However, special things should be kept in mind while worshipping, otherwise, it can be inauspicious rather than auspicious. For instance, It is written in the scriptures that defective idols should not be worshipped. It is said that worshipping such deities does not yield any fruit. If there are such idols in your house, then you should remove them from your house and place them under a tree or give it to the temple. Apart from this, you should not keep the murtis where the gods are fighting. This always leads to creating tension and fighting at home. If <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/product/deepawali-laxmi-puja\">Goddess Lakshmi</a> is in standing mudra, then according to Vastu, you should not keep this picture. With this, Lakshmi does not stay in the house.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, many rituals and havan also require the supervision of an expert, i.e. Pandit. For example, in <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/chaitra-navratri\">Navratri Vrat</a>, Haldi, asafetida, mustard oil, methi, garam masala, and coriander powder are not used. You should only eat rock salt instead of salt. Do not cook meals in refined oil or soybean oil. Do not rub the idol with your thumb in the idol bath. Do not start worshipping Lakshmi in the afternoon, at night, on Krishna Paksha, on Dwadashi date, and on Ashtami. Likewise, many other restrictions are there which we need to follow. Therefore, the role of Pandit is important and irreplaceable.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>How do Pandits help you?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>When you worship at your home, there is no priest while there is a priest in the temple. All the laws and rules of worship are followed in the temple, while the person in the house worships to reveal his devotion and for his own complacency. According to Vedic books, building a temple at home can also be harmful to you. However, you can allot a place of worship in the house for only one goddess or deity whom you consider highly. Some pujas at home do not <a href=\"https://www.pujarambh.com/pandit-ji-for-puja-near-me\">require a Pandit</a>, like evening aarti, daily puja in the morning, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Festivals, celebrations, and fasting all have different meanings. All the celebrations and fasts of Hinduism are related to solar month, lunar month, and constellation month. Each festival has its specific day and time to perform the Puja. While some festival pujas can also be done by oneself with the supervision or advice of Pandit. For example, you can <a href=\"https://g.page/pujarambh?we\">consult an online Pandit </a>and ask him the rules and regulations to do Aarti or havan at home. It can be for Navrati Puja, Diwali Puja, Bhai-Duj, or more. With online booking, you can also organize Puja at your house or a temple. Here, you organize Office-opening puja, new house warming puja, Sarawati Puja, Dosh Nirvana Puja, and more.</p>\n', '2021-05-08 12:33:32', '2021-05-08 12:33:32');
